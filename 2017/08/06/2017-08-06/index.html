		<p>It turned out I was only allowed to do a case study using publicly available
secondary data.
I may have also dodged a bullet there.
While reviewing literature, I&#39;ve come across a few too many primary data
business research papers which were a bit too half-assed.
They usually come up with a hypothesis, call up dozen or so people with loaded
interview questions and come up with conclusions based on those answers.
While, this is probably sufficient in the realm of social sciences,
seems somewhat inadequate in my mind.
These would never qualify to be published in computer science journals I usually
find myself reading.
Also, I find myself arguing with superstitious nutbags about science simply
representing the best of human knowledge and reasoning from time to time.
I expect a greater level of effort to be put into research than a dozen phone
calls.
10000 is a much better number!</p>
<p>I finally decided to go with something along the lines of &quot;application of 
financial forecasting for entrepreneurial opportunity recognition&quot; for my
research topic.
It wasn&#39;t easy to come up with a topic.
I think I&#39;ve read a few too many Nassim Talib books.
That guy hates forecasting with his entire being and I tend to agree with a
lot of his ideas.
From how the preliminary data analysis is looking, I&#39;d say that my study
will produce very similar conclusions.</p>
<p>I am happy with the topic.
Judging by my colleagues&#39; stated background and their comments, mine is probably
one of the broadest topics in my group.
Although, I initially proposed something much broader.
I wanted to do some impact analysis on the side.
Feedback, that came two weeks too late, stated that I should shorten it.
Pivoted to my current topic which is half of what I originally proposed.
Took two weeks off from work to focus exclusively on it.
I am now back on track.
Just gotta finish data analysis and complete my report write-up.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve fallen back to python for this research project.
This makes modelling so much easier.
I usually just use JavaScript or Golang these days at work.
I had completely forgotten how much more productive python was.
If I want to do something crazy like model some time series data with the
logistic map, and use that to produce forecasts, it&#39;s only a dozen or so lines
of scipy code.</p>
<p>Back to work tomorrow.
Went through my email today and it looks like I&#39;ll have to hit the ground
running.
Gonna do some meal planning today so I can free up more time for the research
study.
Only two and half weeks left to finalise my work and submit report.</p>
