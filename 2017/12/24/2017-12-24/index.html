		<p>Earlier, I mentioned my favourite definition of leadership being something
along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>someone assumes a leadership role when someone decides there is a problem, a need or an injustice and takes action to solve the problem, fulfil the need or correct the injustice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this view, leadership archetypes are the different roles
people take in fulfilling a need or solving a problem or correcting an injustice.
There seems to be several schools of thoughts in terms of what these archetypes are.
I&#39;ll do my best consolidate some of the positive ones here:</p>
<h3 id="Teacher-Mentor-Coach"><a href="#Teacher-Mentor-Coach" class="headerlink" title="Teacher / Mentor / Coach"></a>Teacher / Mentor / Coach</h3><p>In fulfilling need for development, these are people who develop other people.
Maybe they have travelled the path before.
Maybe they have experimented with the subject matter or they have more experience.
Or maybe they are just good at coaching or keeping you motivated.</p>
<p>This requires a special kind of skill.
Being good at something does not automatically mean that someone are good at teaching/mentoring other people.
Also, being able to teach something to others does not necessary mean that someone is very good at that skill.
They don&#39;t have to be either.
Those are independent skills to acquire and are both very valuable.</p>
<p>In my experience, these people will talk to you about your goals and hopes
and dreams etc and will enable you in your development.</p>
<h4 id="Student-Mentee-Athlete"><a href="#Student-Mentee-Athlete" class="headerlink" title="Student / Mentee / Athlete"></a>Student / Mentee / Athlete</h4><p>This archetype/role is one that I think does not get mentioned in a lot of literature.
This is the exact opposite of the teacher/mentor role -
the proactive student who is in charge of their own development.</p>
<p>This person will go to you and ask you for your guidance and feedback.
He will ask you to be their mentor etc.</p>
<h4 id="Learners"><a href="#Learners" class="headerlink" title="Learners"></a>Learners</h4><p>There is a third configuration to this role which I think is the best one.
Teachers are greatly respected in every society.
If they are not, I think there is something wrong with that society.
However, I have also experienced instances where the status of the teacher
and the student can be equal and of mutual interest.</p>
<p>I think this happens naturally where the student and the teacher are both focused on improving.
They inspire each other and develop together through shared experiences.
You are comrades in your journey towards improvement.
I think we should be respectful and thankful to anyone who help us grow.
In turn, we should help out others where we can in their growth.</p>
<h3 id="Father-Judge-Manager-Processor"><a href="#Father-Judge-Manager-Processor" class="headerlink" title="Father / Judge / Manager / Processor"></a>Father / Judge / Manager / Processor</h3><p>In terms of getting things done, whether it be via planning and following
a plan or the other extreme of moving towards the general direction of solution,
you need people to &quot;provide oversight, control, moral guidance and caring
protection.&quot;
The main characteristic of this role is the ability to oversee others.
Make sure that they are moving in the right direction and that
their cats and dogs are happy.</p>
<p>The &quot;father&quot; terminology obviously comes from the traditional
image of a father figure some kind of patriarchal family setup.
If you think of your team, your department, your company etc as a family,
these are the people who will make sure that whatever direction
you&#39;re taking your family is not set for doom and make sure that you are
keeping track of your plan.
Some literature also add a creation or direction aspect to this role but I don&#39;t
want to conflate this role with some of the other I want to list whose main
focus is those activities.
My current interpretation of this archetype is a traditional/conservative
middle manager role/wizards of operation who make sure that everyone is happy
and everything is operating smoothly. They communicate and empathise. </p>
<p>I am not downplaying this role when I use words like traditional or
conservative.
This role is obviously one of the most important ones.
If everyone wanted to play the role of the visionary/entrepreneurial leader all
the time, nothing would ever get done.</p>
<p>When I think of someone in this architype, I think of an army leader.
I heard that in the US navy seals, the leader eats after everyone else.
In Sun Tzu&#39;s art of war, he tells the leader to regard their soldiers as children
so they may follow him to the ends of the earth.</p>
<h3 id="Warrior-Knight-Mercenary-Hero-Soldier-Engineer-Theif-Builder-Gambler"><a href="#Warrior-Knight-Mercenary-Hero-Soldier-Engineer-Theif-Builder-Gambler" class="headerlink" title="Warrior / Knight / Mercenary / Hero / Soldier / Engineer / Theif / Builder / Gambler"></a>Warrior / Knight / Mercenary / Hero / Soldier / Engineer / Theif / Builder / Gambler</h3><p>These are people who take risks and action during a crisis.
I&#39;ve lumped them together because they are very similar. However are sub-architypes within these.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can be a knight vs. a mercenary on the dimension of loyalty.</li>
<li>you can be a warrior/knight vs. shadow warrior/dark knight in terms of your regards for rules.</li>
<li>you can be a hero vs. a coward/bystander in terms of your decision to show courage/act independently.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, what is characteristic of these roles are their direct connection/contribution.
They are the doers. They have hold over life and death.
If this was the warring states period in Japan, they would be the Samurais.
If this was an R&amp;D firm, they would be the scientists and engineers.
If this was a car dealership, they would be the salespeople.
I&#39;d put someone who is really good at making deals into this category.
They take leadership position when they decide to act in response
to some need.
They are also characterised due to the direct risk they take.
Whether it is in the modern era in terms of their time or in the distant past in
terms of their lives.</p>
<p>This one is probably hardest to grasp for most people. But it is not incomprehensible.
Think of a modern R&amp;D organisation. Who are the leaders there? Is it the
sponsors who provide research funds? Is it their CEO who provides visions
that are vague enough to mean anything? We certainly pay him the most.
Is it the middle managers who divide up the funding between their teams?
They certainly like to do all the hiring and firing.
Or is it the researchers and scientists who tinker with things day and night to
produce the actual results?
If you ask me, it is either all of them or none of them.
If you still don&#39;t get it, let&#39;s play a game I like to call: &quot;take it out and see.&quot;
Which of the roles explained here can you take out and things would still
function? Say we fired the CEO or all the middle managers or all the scientists or all the engineers?
Would things still function?
You&#39;ll find that the CEO&#39;s leadership role is the least important one.</p>
<h4 id="Strategist-Tactician-Schemer-Spy"><a href="#Strategist-Tactician-Schemer-Spy" class="headerlink" title="Strategist / Tactician / Schemer / Spy"></a>Strategist / Tactician / Schemer / Spy</h4><p>This is sub-archetype I see that is as important as the Warrior archetype.
People in these roles are usually accomplished warriors/knights or have equivalent knowledge
to be able to operate at a meta level to maximise their goals.</p>
<p>There are multiple levels of this. There is the high level strategy.
Things like &quot;we will be customer first&quot; and &quot;we will be a collaboration hub&quot; for example.</p>
<p>However, there is also lower level of strategy that is much more useful/closer to real life.
Some call it tactics or still lump it with strategy.
For example, &quot;we will use this architecture&quot; or &quot;lets invest into to find a better solution for this&quot; or &quot;let&#39;s target this market with this product.&quot;
It is when you know what you can do and how things may turn out and cleverly take
practical steps to reach a more favourable outcome.</p>
<p>For example, something may be ordinarily not possible.
But someone may decide &quot;if we were a little bit clever and did this instead, it could work&quot; and experiment.
And it may lead to a more successful outcome. Or it may not work.
And you may learn that and come one step closer to solving that problem.
The strategist sub-archetype here would correspond to the being clever part.
Rest, I&#39;d put under the visionary archetype.</p>
<h3 id="Visionary-Alchemist"><a href="#Visionary-Alchemist" class="headerlink" title="Visionary / Alchemist"></a>Visionary / Alchemist</h3><p>Someone who imagines possibilities and guides/acts towards bringing them to reality.
I suppose this person is one level above the person who comes up ideas and seeks validation based on it.
They act on turning their ideas into reality.</p>
<p>I suppose you&#39;d put someone like Steve Jobs into this category.
Personally, when I think of a visionary, someone like Einstein or Turing comes to mind.
They did not just come up with ideas.
They went with their ideas. They contributed enough to leave their name in history books.
Probably a high bar to follow for someone from the modern era like Steve Jobs.
I am sure he did he best.</p>
<p>I&#39;d put someone like an entrepreneur in this category.
Maybe someone had a clever business idea.
They went with it. Succeeded or not, they tried to be a leader by trying to make
it happen.</p>
<p>I sometimes put some of my time into a hackathon called random hacks of kindness.
There, individuals called &quot;change makers&quot; pitch ideas for some kind of cause
and usually over a weekend, some hackers get together to build a system or something
that helps further the cause. I&#39;d say those &quot;change makers&quot; are also excellent
examples of this archetypes.</p>
<h4 id="Revolutionary-Crusader"><a href="#Revolutionary-Crusader" class="headerlink" title="Revolutionary / Crusader"></a>Revolutionary / Crusader</h4><p>I see them as a sub-archetype. They are the same as Visionaries.
They differ in that their vision conflicts with status quo / established order.</p>
<h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>There are plenty others. But those I believe are the main ones.
People lead by a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing others,</li>
<li>providing oversight,</li>
<li>contributing time and skills, and</li>
<li>acting on their vision</li>
</ul>
<p>in solving a problem, fulfilling a need or correcting some injustice.</p>
