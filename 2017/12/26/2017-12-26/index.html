		<p>Disclaimer: This article is for you if you are an adult and
conventional wisdom has not been working for you in keeping
you within healthy weight range.
I am not a Doctor.
I just like to play one in the internet.
The advise I&#39;ll give here may conflict with official ones.
Follow at your own risk.
That being said, the advise I&#39;ll give here are the ones that work for me.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve never had a weight problem growing up.
I grew up on high carb diet living on refined sugar.
I refused to eat anything else.
Before my teens. my default meal would be something
along the lines of rice, milk and sugar mixed with some
kind of fruit (like banana or mango).
I ate that every day of my life for years.
If I ate like that now, I&#39;ll probably kill myself within
a year.
However, I was not overweight.
In fact, I was very very skinny.
I as was as skinny as children of my age group get.
Weight and food weren&#39;t things on my mind.
Someone else was always responsible for feeding me.
I was fed breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t much of a problem during my teens either.
My diet did not change all that well.
I started to appreciate some of the other tastes
like umami that comes from meat and pasta and
sour foods and other fruits etc.
I was a little bit over weight but it was not a problem.
I was growing.
I growing a lot more than I was widening.
Weight was not in my mind back then but food probably was.
I ate and I ate.
There was nothing else to to do but to study and to eat.
Perks of having asian parents.</p>
<p>It started becoming a problem when I was an adult.
This was after I had stopped growing.
I started widening instead.
It was early 20s.
I didn&#39;t think of much of it at the time.
I was eating to the recommended guidelines.
The 2 fruit and 5 vegetable crap.
I was away from home then to attend university in Sydney.
I was eating out with friends.
I started drinking around then.
I was having sugary soda with every meal.
I started drinking coffee.
These were the fashionable things to do.</p>
<p>I started taking it seriously one afternoon.
I was struck with sudden chest pain.
I could not stand or walk.
It hurt.
It was bad.
I seriously thought I was gonna die.
I went to a doctor.
He laughed.
He told me to diet and exercise.
Those were foreign words to me.
I had to google up what he meant by diet.</p>
<p>Fast forward 10 years, I am still alive.
I don&#39;t have chest pains any more.
I managed to pick up a sport.
Something I really like.
I go to gym.
I diet from time to time.
I think I have a very good handle over my health now.
But, reflecting on what I do now, I did not always do what I do now.
I researched and followed a lot of advise that did not work for me.
Things written in diet and nutrition websites and fitness magazines.
If you can relate to being in the same boat, this post is for you.
Tips I&#39;ll give here are ones that I&#39;ve found to better my health.
I&#39;ll discuss tips for making the most extreme of diets work.
I&#39;ll also discuss the ones that will make them not required.
Here they are:</p>
<h3 id="Forget-Weight-Management"><a href="#Forget-Weight-Management" class="headerlink" title="Forget Weight Management"></a>Forget Weight Management</h3><p><strong>TLDR: Forget weight management! Track body fat percentage/kilograms
instead.
20% or under is probably a healthy body fat target for both
males and females.</strong></p>
<p>First couple of tips are related to getting your facts straight.
There is a lot of misinformation out there.
Perhaps misinformation is not the right word to use here.
I am sure they work for some people
For those people, no matter what they do, they will probably stay healthy.
Maybe they genetically gifted or are some other kind of freak of nature.
Maybe they do something else that prevents them from gaining weight.
Important thing is that, since these advises do not work for you, you get to stop following them.
The biggest bs I&#39;ve encountered is the weight myth.</p>
<p>There is something called the BMI.
Given your height, it will spit out a healthy weight range for you to
be in.
If you are above it, you need to lose some weight.
If you are below it, you need to gain some.
It is the biggest load of crap out there. Here is why:</p>
<p>First, weight does not matter.
Pick someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger for example.
He is he is probably a freak of nature. But he is an important freak of nature.
His height is 188cm.
According to official guidelines, his weight should be 53.5 - 72kg for him to be healthy.
How much does he weight? 107 kg.
According to official guidelines, he is above and beyond obese.</p>
<p>Is he though?
No chance in hell. He probably still has over 72 kilos of pure muscle
and dense bones despite being 70 now. I am not asking you to become a body
builder.
However, those are things that you want to have to improve your immune system and
for good ageing.
If you are sick all the time from trivial diseases, try making your bones more dense your bones with some high impact training.
Will work a lot better than prescription drugs.
Also, if you don&#39;t want to curl up into a weak old man by the time you are 40,
put some time into gym every once in a while or pick up some kind of sport.
This is especially important if you have a desk job like mine.</p>
<p>Second, some weights just don&#39;t matter.
I can, for example, go on a yoyo diet right now.
I will probably lose 1-2 kg a day over the next few days until I exhaust my
mental strength or die from dehydration.
How? My body will lose slowly sodium and other important minerals
and I will lose a lot of water weight.
Once I start eating, I will gain back my weight almost immediately.
What was the point of this exercise?
Nothing at all.
Did your waistline shrink? Nope.
Most people give up long before their liver runs out of stored glucose
and their body actually adapts to burning fat.
No improvement of health.
Most people who diet a little bit here or there never do.
They learn hate themselves in the process and blame their genes.</p>
<p>Does it mean that we should not keep track of our health?
Absolutely not.
If you have nothing better to track, measure you weight.
That is your MVP.
If you eat bullshit written in official guidelines, don&#39;t exercise and live a sedantary lifestyle,
the BMI guide is probably as good as any.</p>
<p>However, if you care about your health and exercise or play some kind of sport,
upgrade your measurement to this number: your body fat percentage.
If you like a measurement in kilograms, convert that number into
the number of kilograms of fat your body has.
It is the only fitness number that matters.</p>
<p>Why? if you have a lot of fat in your body, you probably also have a fatty liver.
And you are probably at the risk of what doctors refer to as weight related diseases.
And other than muscle and bone density, that is the difference between
a regular old 70 year old fat man and someone like Arnold.
He has a very low body fat content which highlights his body&#39;s definition
and makes him look younger. Here is a visual guide for your reference:</p>
<p><figure class="figure"><img src="/contents/2017-12-26/body-fat-percentage.jpg" alt=""></figure></p>
<p>Also, for the yoyo diet example, when you lose 5kgs of water weight
and feel like stabbing yourself in the eye in the process,
you learn to not repeat such exercises in futility when you measure
the right metrics.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to measure this. There are calipers, DEXA scans,
biometric scales. I personally don&#39;t recommend invasive techniques
like DEXA. Although, it is probably the most accurate measure,
you are practically X-raying your body every time you
want to get a measure. I like to save that kind of radiation
exposure for special occasions like when I break a leg or something.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t measure, you are practically in the dark.
If you are not in control with accurate measurements,
you&#39;ll easily full yourself with shit advise written in
nutritionist websites and fitness magazines.
Don&#39;t waste your time.
Start measuring.
Experiment with your food and your body and your
exercises.
See what works for you and follow them.
Don&#39;t do things that does not work for you.
The other part is, once you start making the right kind of progress, nothing will motivate you and help you stay on track than yourself seeing your own progress.
It works a lot better than telling all your friends about it.</p>
<h3 id="Stop-Being-A-Vegan"><a href="#Stop-Being-A-Vegan" class="headerlink" title="Stop Being A Vegan"></a>Stop Being A Vegan</h3><p>Have you ever tried to be a vegetarian or vegan for improving health?
Chances are that you have that thin/attractive friend
who claims that their health is attributed to being a vegan.</p>
<p>I am not gonna deny it.
You could probably lose weight by being a vegan if your body
became malfunctioned in a way for that to happen.
I can&#39;t think of any other reasons as to why it would work.
I, like you, know way too many fat vegans.
Most people who claim that it improves health were either
malnutritioned of essential minerals prior to being a vegan
or have one of those freak of nature bodies.
I have also been there and done it.
I can confirm that it is simply superstition.
Much like a lot of other superstitious mumbo jumbo a lot of people who would be suckers for being vegan would believe in.
Astrology for example.</p>
<p>If it works for you, then great.
I&#39;d claim that it would work for you even if you didn&#39;t.
However, it most probably won&#39;t.
And don&#39;t damage your health permanently in some way by following weird diets.
My recommendation: eat everything. That includes vegetables.</p>
<p>My one rule for diets is no carbs. Works a lot better for my body than no fats
or no meat. But I break it religiously. Went for a holiday to Thailand recently.
Had mango sticky rice almost every day I was there. Contrary to a lot of popular
wisdom, I don&#39;t eat lean any more. My diet is full of fats.
My favourite dish is pork belly stuffed in eggplants.
I fry my vegetables in coconut oil and salted butter and angus fat and duck fat.
And I am as healthy as I&#39;ve ever been in the history of my health.</p>
<h3 id="Stop-Exercising"><a href="#Stop-Exercising" class="headerlink" title="Stop Exercising"></a>Stop Exercising</h3><p><strong>TLDR: exercise for improving health; not burning fat.</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever heard of fat burning exercises?
Every single treadmill I&#39;ve seen has a chart that shows a fat burning zone.
Apparently, if your heart rate is within a certain range, it will
burn fat instead of the glucose in your bloodstream and those stored in your liver.
Complete utter non-sense.</p>
<p>I did these fat burning exercises for years expecting them to reduce my waistline.
They never worked.
Also, don&#39;t think that just by gaining a little bit of muscle though
exercising, you are gonna magically lose all your fats.
If you have weight problems, chances are that your gains won&#39;t even be visible.
Soon, you will go back to blaming your genes and start avoiding your non obese
friends to make yourself try to feel better.</p>
<p>If you are gonna exercise, do it for the right reasons.
Those are: improving strength/flexibility/speed/endurance/bone density etc.
Those can improve the quality of your life even if you are fat.
But don&#39;t do it for burning fat. Why? Because 99.99% of fat gains/losses are due to nutrition.
I&#39;ve heard bs like muscles will help you metabolise more energy and hence help burn fat.
Unless you have muscles the size of Arnold and adjusted eating, I&#39;d say not so much.
Exercising can greatly enhance your fat loss efforts if your eating behaviour is correct.
However, if you are doing the same old thing, exercising won&#39;t help much.
In fact, if you are overweight, you are more likely to injure yourself exercising.
So before you turn your fat down to a safe range, you probably shouldn&#39;t get too crazy.</p>
<h3 id="Eliminate-Stress"><a href="#Eliminate-Stress" class="headerlink" title="Eliminate Stress"></a>Eliminate Stress</h3><p>This one should be a no brainer.
Stress adversely affects your health.
I&#39;ve heard things like stress turns your body alkaline and increases your natural insulin level.
I don&#39;t know. I am not a doctor.
However, I have observed that stress causes me lose sleep.
And losing sleep makes me hungry.</p>
<h3 id="Control-Eating-Times"><a href="#Control-Eating-Times" class="headerlink" title="Control Eating Times"></a>Control Eating Times</h3><p><strong>TLDR: Eat Less Often</strong></p>
<p>If you have weight problems, there is a very good chance that you eat too much
too often. The former here is less of a problem than the latter.
Instead of going on crazy low calorie diets, or restricting the types of food you eat,
simply reduce the number of times a day you eat and see what happens.</p>
<p>If you are fat, you probably have developed insulin resistance.
Every time you eat, your body releases insulin.
This is a hormone whose job it is to stop burning
fat and storing glucose in bloodstream as fat.
Think of it as a relay that governs whether you gain or lose fat.
Ask your doctor if you can burn fat while you have insulin in your body.
The answer he will give you is a big fat NO.
Other than not being able to burn fat when this hormone is present,
nothing good is ever associated prolonged levels of insulin in your body.
Things commonly discussed are some cancers, bad skin etc.
You also get to develop insulin resistance.
This is where your body ends up releasing a lot more insulin
than necessary and causes your body to store a lot more fat.
This eventually leads to type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>In the west, people usually have three meals a day: breakfast, lunch and dinner.
People who are fat usually also have snacks in between.
There is a &quot;sugar&quot; culture here in Australia where people think that
you need a constant supply of energy and nutrients through eating
in your body for it to work.
Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>This comes from taking a inorganic/washing machine view to
human body.
A washing machine can not operate without a constant supply of energy.
However, human body does not quite work the same way.
Your body is a lot smarter than the doctors and nutritionists
who think this way.
Your body stores energy and essential nutrients it needs
in its storage in case you run low.
If you stop eating and drinking, it will probably take you over a week
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">before you die</a>.
If you have access to water and essential minerals, it will be months before you die
from starvation.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: before the agricultural revolution, humans did not have
constant supply of food.
People went through periods of feast and famine.
How did they survive?
We evolved to not live on 2 fruits and 5 vegetables a day.
When you start living on 2 fruits and 5 vegetables a day, you start
to have developed world diseases like cancer and diabetes.
I will confess to not having had a slice of fruit in over a month and I am fine.
We will go more into that in controlling what you eat. However, the first step
and the most beneficial one is controlling how often you eat.</p>
<p>Eat as much as you think you need but at the very least, reduce your eating times
to 3 meals a day.
Without reducing the amount of food you eat, there are a few ways to further
improving insulin issues:</p>
<p>First one is to reduce the number of meals.
Unless you are 12, breakfast is probably not the most important meal of the day.
If you are not hungry, skip it.
There is no medical basis for the western 3 meal eating pattern.
Your body will store everything it needs for days and months.
Instead of eating more often, eat more when you are hungry.</p>
<p>Second is reducing eating times to a certain number of hours a day.
There is the famous fast 5 diet when all the eating of the day is done
within a 5 hour window in the day. I&#39;ve seen
versions where the eating window is 8 hours or less than 5 hours.
The principle is the same.
What you need to know about these diets is that they work like magic.
It restricts the times of a day where there is insulin in your blood
stream to a few hours.
It probably slowly reverses insulin resistance.
I&#39;ve also observed that effect of alcohol and other medication
increases when you are doing this form of diets.</p>
<p>Third, I&#39;ve also read that regular exercising lowers insulin levels in your body.
I have yet to experiment with it but it seems plausible.
Exercising would lower blood glucose.
It would not make sense for the body to have high levels of insulin then.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you are going to restrict the amount of times you eat
or skip a meal, the best one to do is the one before sleep.
During the first cycle of deep sleep, your body releases a lot of growth
hormone.
That helps your body grow, perform essential repairs and improve skin etc.
It is the largest fat burning hormone out there.
Effect of that greatly lessens if you have high levels of insulin in your body
at the time.
If you want better health, have dinner a couple of hours you go to bed.
Instead of snacking before bed, eat more during dinner.
Add some essential fats to your food.
It&#39;ll make you less hungry.</p>
<h3 id="Control-What-Type-Of-Food-You-Eat"><a href="#Control-What-Type-Of-Food-You-Eat" class="headerlink" title="Control What Type Of Food You Eat"></a>Control What Type Of Food You Eat</h3><p><strong> TLDR: remove bad carbohydrates from diet; start consuming fats </strong></p>
<p>This section is for you if you have come as far as you can by eating less times a day.
If you think that you have reached some kind of stasis with your body fat percentage
with eating only once a day and you feel like you are still unhealthy.
Well, it is time to start experimenting with food types.
Most people will not need to come this far.
But if you do, this is what will work:</p>
<p>You will never have these foods again: sugar, anything
with fructose, simple/starchy carbohydrates. Seriously.</p>
<p>First, if you are gonna do this properly, no sugar means absolutely no sugar.
It means no brown sugar. It means no honey.
There is absolutely no reason to have refined sugar.
If you need to sweeten, go for artificial sweeteners.
Yes some of the artificial sweeteners may have temporary adverse effects,
e.g. cause diphtheria, when consumed in large quantities.
Even if that happened, it is probably a
very small price to pay if you really want to have that cake and don&#39;t
want to stab yourself in the eye afterwards.
That is, only if you think you want to come this far.
I don&#39;t. But I have experimented with it. And I know that it works.
So far, I haven&#39;t had a bad experience with Erythritol.
Although, be warned that these artificial sweetner
compounds are of different sizes to sucrose.
Taste aside, they will act differently to sugar.
So you may need to adjust you recipe when cooking with these.</p>
<p>Second, no fruits.
There is absolutely no reason to consume fruits.
Fruits have vitamin c? Veges have a lot more.
Fruits have potassium? Veges have a lot more.
Fruits have fibre? Veges have a lot more.
I think you get the pattern.
If you need conviencing, look up the chemical compound
for table sugar (sucrose) and look up the one for fruit sugar
(fructose).
You&#39;ll find to your shock that one is made of the other.
If sugar is bad, both are.</p>
<p>Third, avoid starchy carbohydrates.
No pasta - no rice - no brown rice - not even wholemeal bs.
You are most probably familiar with glycemic index (GI).
Nutritionists usually advise that lower GI food is good.
Yes, they are. It is because lower GI carbs are usually more complex,
more mineral rich that take longer for the body to absorb stuff out of.
That is - it provides energy for you longer.
It is probably true but there is also some BS here.
Your liver stores enough glycogen to last 2-3 days.
If you exercise heavily, you will still last over a day.
You don&#39;t need to eat low GI food for slow release of energy.
That part is BS.
Starchy carbohydrates are also foods we did not have
much of before the agricultural revolution.
I am not gonna sprout bullshit like eat in moderation.
If you need to come this far to get your health sorted then
your body needs extreme adjustments to get back to the right
track.
Avoid all these foods altogether.
They don&#39;t agree with your body.</p>
<p>What about Asians? They eat a lot of carbs. Well, what about them.
Check their latest national health stats.
As they adapt western eating habits more and more,
they are on their way to becoming just as unhealthy as the rest of us in terms of developed world diseases.
I&#39;ve read some BS article suggesting that apparently the Japanese
have some gene mutation that let them absorb carbohydrates more efficiently.
I don&#39;t know about that.
I am very used to seeing Japanese faces and they look just as fat and ugly to me
as all the other races in the world.</p>
<p>What to eat instead? If you are up to here, it is time to start burning fat.
There is only one condition that need to be fulfilled for burning fat:
Your liver&#39;s stored energy reserve must be empty.
Well there are two.
You need to not have insulin in your blood stream.
When it is empty and your body needs to use energy, it will start burning fat.
Best way to kick start into that state is doing some form of fasting where you
don&#39;t eat any food for 2-3 days. Exercising during this period
can speed up the process.
If you get that bad headache, it is due to your body losing water and sodium.
I usually start taking a cocktail of 98% water mixed with a little bit of salt, lime and apple cidar vinegar at this point.
You will usually feel nauseous when you start burning fat/ketones instead of glucose.
Napping will help.
There is a common misconception that your brain needs glucose to function.
It does not.
Your brain will be a lot sharper when you are burning ketones instead of glucose.
There will just initially be minor discomfort due to low energy and glucose withdrawal
when your body is switching over what it is burning.</p>
<p>Once you start burning fat, you will want to keep burning fat.
There is a lot of literature out there in ketogenic diet which you can follow.
Basically, there is a second scale called the insulin index which measures
how much insulin is released in response to the food you consume,
You want to consume food to keep insulin release in your body to
the bare minimum. Typically, you will consume a lot of fats, some good quality
vegetables and some protein.
It is important to not consume too much protein as the body can convert excess
protein into glucose which can increase insulin.
Consuming fats will also help you feel more full and stay full for longer.
Be careful as to not consume too much calories.
If you eat too much, you will still gain fat.</p>
<p>The other thing to keep in mind is that there is a limit to how much
fat you can burn in a day. It is tied to the release of growth hormone during
sleep and how much you breathe. When everything is running smoothly,
I&#39;ve experienced loosing up to 300-500grams of fat a day (not water weight or muscle).
If you want to measure how much fat you
are burning, you can get yourself a breath acetone meter which is a by product
of the fat burning process.</p>
