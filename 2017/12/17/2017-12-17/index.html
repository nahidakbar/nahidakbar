		<p>Saw this meme the other day:</p>
<p><figure class="figure"><img src="/contents/2017-12-17/boss-leader-engineer.png" alt=""></figure></p>
<p>Reminded me of some past episodes and made me chuckle.</p>
<p><s>Leadership has been a subject of interest from the earliest days of human society.</s></p>
<p>That is wrong!
In my mind, leadership something more natural and intrinsic to life.
I quite dislike the notion where humans are viewed to be somehow external to or above nature.
Sure we don&#39;t live naked in caves and trees any more and we have people in space.
However, to get you down from your rocket ship, consider the following: if another big meteor fell on earth tomorrow, most humans will die along with other species in nature we claim superiority over.
In addition, regardless of however you define leadership, you will no doubt find examples in non-human species.
That is - it is not something unique to or invented by humans.
I don&#39;t, however, expect this reflection to be relevant to baboons and naked mole rats.
So I also want to keep things practical by not straying too far from my own species
and my own practice.</p>
<p>So what is leadership? Let&#39;s check out <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/leadership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dictionary.com</a>.
It defines leadership as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>noun</p>
<ol>
<li>the position or function of a leader, a person who guides or directs a group:<blockquote>
<p>He managed to maintain his leadership of the party despite heavy opposition.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>ability to lead:<blockquote>
<p>As early as sixth grade she displayed remarkable leadership potential.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>an act or instance of leading; guidance; direction:<blockquote>
<p>They prospered under his strong leadership.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>the leaders of a group:<blockquote>
<p>The union leadership agreed to arbitrate.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading that, you have probably agreed to one or more of the definitions and gave them a mental tick of approval.
Time to clue you in on something.
At least from my perspective, these definitions are all missing a lot of crucial things.
That is: why? to what end?
I&#39;ve checked at least two other dictionaries and they don&#39;t fare much better.
It does not make it better when you define leadership as a process or science or art or rational or irrational.
It might have been something so obvious so they decided to not put it in.
However, it is the most important thing to me for the following reasons:</p>
<p>First, it simplifies the problem of leadership. Say there is certain issue,
problem X, that needs to be resolved. Which of the following is a better
way of framing this problem? 1) problem is to resolve x through leading
a team of followers or 2) problem is to resolve x. I would take 2 over 1
any day of the week. Why? Because - problem solving 101 - it opens up options.
With 2, the problem can be solved any way possible. For example, hiring
and expert to do the work or, my favourite, going to the root cause of problem X
and eliminating it so that X ceases to be problem.
However, with 1, it assumed that a very fixed, potentially ineffective, inefficient or risky method
of accomplishing potentially less than an ideal solution for problem X.</p>
<p>Second, here are some trick questions for thought: Would a person be less of a leader if he/she:</p>
<ul>
<li>resolved the problem without a team following them; or</li>
<li>lead a large team as opposed to small one; or</li>
<li>was old or young; or</li>
<li>was tall or short; or</li>
<li>was male or female or some other gender; or</li>
<li>was of white skin colour or black or yellow or...; or</li>
<li>was superstitious or not; or</li>
<li>was experienced vs inexperienced; or</li>
<li>spoke perfect English or not; or</li>
<li>knew how to spell or not; or</li>
<li>was good at public speaking or not; or</li>
<li>lead a diverse team or not; or</li>
<li>lead a multidisciplinary team or not; or</li>
<li>was technically literate or not; or</li>
<li>was a rock star or a peon; or</li>
<li>followed some mythology or not; or</li>
<li>consulted a consultant or not; or</li>
<li>was a subject matter expert or not; or</li>
<li>owned many slaves or didn&#39;t; or</li>
<li>was introverted or extroverted; or</li>
<li>was a born leader or not; or</li>
<li>was from the royal family or not; or</li>
<li>insert your stupid leadership criteria here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on how biased you are, and trust me everyone is biased in some ways, you may have not liked how some of these sentences were worded.
Even I didn&#39;t like listing all these.
However, if you change the definition of leadership from things like &quot;influencing/emotional manipulation&quot; and &quot;standing above others&quot; to
&quot;bringing positive change&quot; or something more practical, these things stop to matter.</p>
<p>Third, you get problems when you don&#39;t ask this question.
Say the mad king from game of thrones asks his solders to burn everyone in city with wildfire.
Should this order be followed? When you ask this question - king is a leader who people pay tax to and follow to keep them safe etc and make country
more prosperous etc.
When they stop doing that, they cease to be their leader.
So the mad king gets burned instead.
Why am I giving example from a fictional story? I obviously don&#39;t want to piss off real examples.
However, these examples are not absent even in developed/lower power distance cultures.
For example, you have people in positions of authority sexually abusing people under them.
Once again, I am not going to piss of real examples.
This also happen in nature.
For example, in most tournament species in nature, there are leaders called &quot;alphas&quot; who do whatever they want
in their group.
Humans, of-course, are not tournament species and modern human societal values do not condone these forms of power abuse.</p>
<p>At last, due to these reasons, it is wrong to define leadership something along the lines of standing above others.
The best definition of leadership I&#39;ve found so far is in the High Performance Leadership manual from
Toastmasters. It goes something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>someone assumes a leadership role when someone decides there is a problem, a need or an injustice and takes action to solve the problem, fulfil the need or correct the injustice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These types of definitions are not probably attractive to most people.
It does not sound as impressive as &quot;being the chosen one&quot; or
&quot;the leader of men&quot; or what not and
does not bring assciated social validation or financial benefits.
Those are typical reasons why most people pursue leadership
and why it has probably become a hundreds of billion dollar industry
worldwide.
However, I am more attracted to the above definition.
I am probably a bit selfishly motvivated in my belief as it does
not require having a crowd following you to be a leader.
Yes, I am no celebrety or thought leader and
the tought creeps me out a little bit.</p>
<p>At the same time, this kind of drive feels much more authentic to me than
the trashy literature that gets sold as authentic leadership.
It suggests to me that to become a great leader, instead of trying to be a
great leader, you should focus on the problem you are trying to solve,
the need you are trying and the injustice you are trying to correct.
That is - great leaders aren&#39;t obsessed on being great leaders.
They are focused on their objectives, missions, values etc.
Only in that context, I can see being able to rally others&#39; support
to be an asset. It should not be an honour or a priviledge.
Instead, the leader should be thankful in whatever followership support
they get for their problem, need or cause.</p>
<p>Followership, in this context, is also a form of leadership.
That is - if you decided that the particular cause is worth your time
and decide that you can provide some value.
Leaders, then, should be aknowledged based on the value they personally bring.
It takes great wishdom and leadership to sometimes go
with the flow in trying something new contrary to personal experience
when someone else is taking the lead and learn from that experiment.
Ofcourse, if there is some reason why you think the path you are on
will not work, it is part of leadership let that be known.
Malicious compliance is unethical.
However, in my book, the only people who are not leaders are people blindly
following orders and processes.
People not in control over their own actions.
People who don&#39;t ask the question &quot;why?&quot; and &quot;to what end?&quot; .
They are just exchanging their followership for salary.
Asking &quot;why?&quot; and &quot;to what end?&quot; also leads to asking &quot;how to better?&quot;</p>
