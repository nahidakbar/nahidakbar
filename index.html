		<p>This educational is from toastmasters
leadership excellence series.
Purpose of this series is for all of us to become
better at leadership.</p>
<p>I have not picked this topic because
I think I know the most about this topic.
I have picked it because
I have more horror stories to share
where I&#39;ve seen examples of this being
done poorly and I have recognised
that I myself have a lot to learn
in this area.</p>
<h3 id="Why-delegate"><a href="#Why-delegate" class="headerlink" title="Why delegate?"></a>Why delegate?</h3><p>We delegate for three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To free our own time. We may not have the time or may want to spend time selectively on areas and projects we went to develop of.</li>
<li>To get things done faster. There may be cases where delegation is feasible. For example, when you have a very complex ad-hoc process, delegation may slow things down instead. However, where it is feasible, doing things in a team may help get things done faster.</li>
<li>To other give people development opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-is-delegation"><a href="#What-is-delegation" class="headerlink" title="What is delegation?"></a>What is delegation?</h3><p>Definitions of delegation must have two aspects:</p>
<p>First is the transfer of responsibility.
Delegation here is distinguished from training or supervision.
While those activities and ideas have value, delegation is distinctly
different in that the responsibility for the outcome
is transferred to the person delegated.
We might be training or supervising someone closely
where they perform tasks according to our instruction
to learn something.
However, in these cases, should the endeavour fail, the responsibility
for failure should go to the trainer or the supervisor.</p>
<p>This leads nicely to the second aspect - empowerment to accomplish
goals.
This is where delegation is distinguished from things like
micromanagement.
When we are closely supervising someone
and they have done exactly as we have told them to the best of their ability,
they can not blamed when the endeavour fails.
When we delegate something to someone,
it implies that they have them all the decision making
authority over everything that needs to be influenced
to accomplish the set task.
This is the aspect of empowerment.</p>
<p>An example of this where these aspects
are absent might be that micromanager
who after making you responsible for
a project tries to influence every
small detail of the project.
Another example might be
an organisation where you
might be responsible for a project
but getting your tasks done requires
approvals from a manager higher in the chain.</p>
<p>There are times where this might be necessary.
I had a year 10 work experience student couple of years ago.
I tried to be a good manager and not a micromanager.
At least initially, and delegated them some tasks.
I left him alone for an entire day.
I was a little bit impressed by his resume and what he said.
He had published an app in the appstore.
I have yet to publish an app in the appstore. Never had a work or hobby project that involved doing that.
But of course, as I had learned, a year 10 student is not half as good as they think they are.
I discovered on day two that not only did he not accomplish
anything, he was making some really stupid mistakes in the
little progress he had made.
So there are times where you may need to
micromanage things a little.</p>
<p>However, I would also argue that there are better ways of doing it.
My current manager does it really well.
It might be partially because he does not have a lot of time for me.
If he received any signals where he thinks I might be going
off track on a project,
he suggests that I hold a project review
or informally talk with another colleague on a different team.
You can encourage them to seek feedback.
For example, I have asked my mentor to be brutal if she sees anything wrong with
what I do.
I was going to ask her to do it but the way the conversation flowed at the time,
it was almost as if she put the words in
my mouth.
These work a lot better the the manager barging in and start micromanaging
whatever respect you might have for your manage out of your system.</p>
<h3 id="When-to-delegate"><a href="#When-to-delegate" class="headerlink" title="When to delegate?"></a>When to delegate?</h3><p>There is a section in the educational material on barriers to delegation.
And this section corresponds to that.
But instead of going through the points, I want to give you a framework
for thinking about it. It is called the situational leadership model which
looks something like this:</p>
<p><figure class="figure"><img src="/contents/2018-01-30/situational.png" alt="From https://www.kenblanchard.com"><figcaption class="figure__caption">From https://www.kenblanchard.com</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>This model splits people in terms of two variables. First is the level of commitment
where people are put into two categories - highly committed (bottom half) and
not so committed (top half). Second variable is their level of competence
where people are also put into two categories - highly capable (left half)
and the highly incapable (right half). This model suggests
that people usually vary across the spectrum in terms of these two
variables and different strategies work for different people.</p>
<p>Delegation here only works for people who are highly committed
and are highly capable (the bottom left quadrant).
If they are highly capable but is not committed, you have to get their
motivation level up by supportive/participate behaviour (top left quadrant).
If they are highly committed but they are not as competent,
you can exhibit telling/directing behaviour (bottom right).
This is where micromanagement shines.
If they are neither committed nor capable, you have to either
coach them or sell things to them.</p>
<p>The handout gives some other points which you can put into
this framework and talks about some more like insecurity and selfishness
on behalf of the leader. But I want to talk about another point
that is not in the handout. That is, you can sometimes destroy a good team
by delegating poorly.
I will give two examples. One somewhat artificial and
another from my current team.</p>
<p>First example is from a game I play called left for dead 2.
Don&#39;t shut your brain off. This example has nothing to do with computer gaming.
It is a computer game that is designed in a way where you
have to work in a team of 4 to survive a zombie apocalyptic scenario.
If you don&#39;t have a good team like an incompetent team or dysfunctional team,
you quickly die.
Depending on the chinning, sometimes you can make do if you have one or two members who are highly
competent.
So one night I was playing in a game in a team of three.
We were all highly competent.
In fact, we were competing within the team to see who can get the highest score.
In term literature, you could say that this was an example of a highly performing
self organising team.
Then this guy comes along to join us as the fourth member.
And he suddenly starts using mic.
He starts telling everyone what we should do moments after we decide in our head
that we are going to do.
We has trying to play &quot;Mr. Leader&quot; as he saw his role was and
other team members were extremely annoyed by that.
I knew this was the case when he got into trouble and
no one decided to come to his aid until it has too late.
At this point, he abruptly rage quit. He left the team.</p>
<p>The second example would be something like my current work example.
We have a team what you could also say is a highly performing self organising team.
The team consists of three specialists, I being one of them, and a project manager.
It is not a team where the leader is playing &quot;Mr leader&quot; and getting things
done through delegation or micromanagement.
We don&#39;t need that.
In fact, in 99% of the time, out project managers will simply go
what is going on with you and is there anything I can help with.
We are all proactive and self managing and we delegate things to
her and we delegate things to each other.
We talk to each other and get things done.
Everyone in the team performs a leadership role.</p>
<p>If you are ever in an environment like that, don&#39;t try and ruin it by
unnecessarily trying to delegate things or playing the micromanager.
So it is important to think about when not to delegate things
as leader as much as when to delegate things.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-effectively"><a href="#How-to-effectively" class="headerlink" title="How to effectively?"></a>How to effectively?</h3><p>First step in effective delegation is periodisation.
Simply decide what needs to be delegated.
As we have been discussing, not all work can be delegated.
You may not have the right team members and you may not have the right tasks.
Identify the ones that can be delegated.</p>
<p>Second step is matching availability to capability.
Decide whom to delegate to.
We have talked about the situational leadership model.
These can help inform what strategy to pursue in getting
tasks done. You may choose to decide that
something is not best delegated. Maybe you instead decide
to coach a motivated team member instead through the process
instead. Some people also suggest do it yourself first
so you can describe the objectives clearly.</p>
<p>Third step is assigning responsibility.
It is important to make the assignment clear and specific.
If you read the educational material, it will
ask you fully describe the task and process
and identify training needs and resources
and everything.
I personally don&#39;t like this style of task allocation.
This stems from a style of thinking originated
in the 1900s in America where the managers had to
get a workforce of largely uneducated workforce
to do tasks and not reduce quality of products.
If you allocate tasks this way, you team will be
unhappy and unsatisfied with their job etc.
I think it works better if you clearly specify
the objectives that needs to accomplished.
So they are free to reach the objective
however they want to.</p>
<p>Fourth step is measuring performance.
Autonomy, as we&#39;ve discussed is very important.
They need to be able to solve problems by
themselves and be creative and all that.
However, being completely indifferent to progress
towards objectives is also an anti-pattern.
You need to make sure that progress is being made.
As my first mentor taught me many years ago:
You need to always ask the question: is this
taking me where I want to go?
Is there a better way?</p>
<p>Final step is giving credit and not blaming them so much
should the endeavour fail.
Feedback giving is not a foreign concept to us toastmasters.
We know about the sandwich technique.
It is important to cultivate a culture of feedback giving
in your team.
Not just once a year during performance reviews and what not.
And I think it starts by you asking your team:
how can i do this better?
When things go well, you need to give credit to your team
members publicly.
This will encourage them to be more proactive.
And when things don&#39;t go well, you need to not public blame them.
Give feedback in private.</p>

	<div class="article__infos">
		<span class="article__date">2017-12-26</span><br />
		
		
	</div>

	

	
		<p>Disclaimer: This article is for you if you are an adult and
conventional wisdom has not been working for you in keeping
you within healthy weight range.
I am not a Doctor.
I just like to play one in the internet.
The advise I&#39;ll give here may conflict with official ones.
Follow at your own risk.
That being said, the advise I&#39;ll give here are the ones that work for me.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve never had a weight problem growing up.
I grew up on high carb diet living on refined sugar.
I refused to eat anything else.
Before my teens. my default meal would be something
along the lines of rice, milk and sugar mixed with some
kind of fruit (like banana or mango).
I ate that every day of my life for years.
If I ate like that now, I&#39;ll probably kill myself within
a year.
However, I was not overweight.
In fact, I was very very skinny.
I as was as skinny as children of my age group get.
Weight and food weren&#39;t things on my mind.
Someone else was always responsible for feeding me.
I was fed breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t much of a problem during my teens either.
My diet did not change all that well.
I started to appreciate some of the other tastes
like umami that comes from meat and pasta and
sour foods and other fruits etc.
I was a little bit over weight but it was not a problem.
I was growing.
I growing a lot more than I was widening.
Weight was not in my mind back then but food probably was.
I ate and I ate.
There was nothing else to to do but to study and to eat.
Perks of having asian parents.</p>
<p>It started becoming a problem when I was an adult.
This was after I had stopped growing.
I started widening instead.
It was early 20s.
I didn&#39;t think of much of it at the time.
I was eating to the recommended guidelines.
The 2 fruit and 5 vegetable crap.
I was away from home then to attend university in Sydney.
I was eating out with friends.
I started drinking around then.
I was having sugary soda with every meal.
I started drinking coffee.
These were the fashionable things to do.</p>
<p>I started taking it seriously one afternoon.
I was struck with sudden chest pain.
I could not stand or walk.
It hurt.
It was bad.
I seriously thought I was gonna die.
I went to a doctor.
He laughed.
He told me to diet and exercise.
Those were foreign words to me.
I had to google up what he meant by diet.</p>
<p>Fast forward 10 years, I am still alive.
I don&#39;t have chest pains any more.
I managed to pick up a sport.
Something I really like.
I go to gym.
I diet from time to time.
I think I have a very good handle over my health now.
But, reflecting on what I do now, I did not always do what I do now.
I researched and followed a lot of advise that did not work for me.
Things written in diet and nutrition websites and fitness magazines.
If you can relate to being in the same boat, this post is for you.
Tips I&#39;ll give here are ones that I&#39;ve found to better my health.
I&#39;ll discuss tips for making the most extreme of diets work.
I&#39;ll also discuss the ones that will make them not required.
Here they are:</p>
<h3 id="Forget-Weight-Management"><a href="#Forget-Weight-Management" class="headerlink" title="Forget Weight Management"></a>Forget Weight Management</h3><p><strong>TLDR: Forget weight management! Track body fat percentage/kilograms
instead.
20% or under is probably a healthy body fat target for both
males and females.</strong></p>
<p>First couple of tips are related to getting your facts straight.
There is a lot of misinformation out there.
Perhaps misinformation is not the right word to use here.
I am sure they work for some people
For those people, no matter what they do, they will probably stay healthy.
Maybe they genetically gifted or are some other kind of freak of nature.
Maybe they do something else that prevents them from gaining weight.
Important thing is that, since these advises do not work for you, you get to stop following them.
The biggest bs I&#39;ve encountered is the weight myth.</p>
<p>There is something called the BMI.
Given your height, it will spit out a healthy weight range for you to
be in.
If you are above it, you need to lose some weight.
If you are below it, you need to gain some.
It is the biggest load of crap out there. Here is why:</p>
<p>First, weight does not matter.
Pick someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger for example.
He is he is probably a freak of nature. But he is an important freak of nature.
His height is 188cm.
According to official guidelines, his weight should be 53.5 - 72kg for him to be healthy.
How much does he weight? 107 kg.
According to official guidelines, he is above and beyond obese.</p>
<p>Is he though?
No chance in hell. He probably still has over 72 kilos of pure muscle
and dense bones despite being 70 now. I am not asking you to become a body
builder.
However, those are things that you want to have to improve your immune system and
for good ageing.
If you are sick all the time from trivial diseases, try making your bones more dense your bones with some high impact training.
Will work a lot better than prescription drugs.
Also, if you don&#39;t want to curl up into a weak old man by the time you are 40,
put some time into gym every once in a while or pick up some kind of sport.
This is especially important if you have a desk job like mine.</p>
<p>Second, some weights just don&#39;t matter.
I can, for example, go on a yoyo diet right now.
I will probably lose 1-2 kg a day over the next few days until I exhaust my
mental strength or die from dehydration.
How? My body will lose slowly sodium and other important minerals
and I will lose a lot of water weight.
Once I start eating, I will gain back my weight almost immediately.
What was the point of this exercise?
Nothing at all.
Did your waistline shrink? Nope.
Most people give up long before their liver runs out of stored glucose
and their body actually adapts to burning fat.
No improvement of health.
Most people who diet a little bit here or there never do.
They learn hate themselves in the process and blame their genes.</p>
<p>Does it mean that we should not keep track of our health?
Absolutely not.
If you have nothing better to track, measure you weight.
That is your MVP.
If you eat bullshit written in official guidelines, don&#39;t exercise and live a sedantary lifestyle,
the BMI guide is probably as good as any.</p>
<p>However, if you care about your health and exercise or play some kind of sport,
upgrade your measurement to this number: your body fat percentage.
If you like a measurement in kilograms, convert that number into
the number of kilograms of fat your body has.
It is the only fitness number that matters.</p>
<p>Why? if you have a lot of fat in your body, you probably also have a fatty liver.
And you are probably at the risk of what doctors refer to as weight related diseases.
And other than muscle and bone density, that is the difference between
a regular old 70 year old fat man and someone like Arnold.
He has a very low body fat content which highlights his body&#39;s definition
and makes him look younger. Here is a visual guide for your reference:</p>
<p><figure class="figure"><img src="/contents/2017-12-26/body-fat-percentage.jpg" alt=""></figure></p>
<p>Also, for the yoyo diet example, when you lose 5kgs of water weight
and feel like stabbing yourself in the eye in the process,
you learn to not repeat such exercises in futility when you measure
the right metrics.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to measure this. There are calipers, DEXA scans,
biometric scales. I personally don&#39;t recommend invasive techniques
like DEXA. Although, it is probably the most accurate measure,
you are practically X-raying your body every time you
want to get a measure. I like to save that kind of radiation
exposure for special occasions like when I break a leg or something.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t measure, you are practically in the dark.
If you are not in control with accurate measurements,
you&#39;ll easily fool yourself with shit advise written in
nutritionist websites and fitness magazines.
Don&#39;t waste your time.
Start measuring.
Experiment with your food and your body and your
exercises.
See what works for you and follow them.
Don&#39;t do things that does not work for you.
The other part is, once you start making the right kind of progress, nothing will motivate you and help you stay on track than yourself seeing your own progress.
It works a lot better than telling all your friends about it.</p>
<h3 id="Stop-Being-A-Vegan"><a href="#Stop-Being-A-Vegan" class="headerlink" title="Stop Being A Vegan"></a>Stop Being A Vegan</h3><p>Have you ever tried to be a vegetarian or vegan for improving health?
Chances are that you have that thin/attractive friend
who claims that their health is attributed to being a vegan.</p>
<p>I am not gonna deny it.
You could probably lose weight by being a vegan if your body
became malfunctioned in a way for that to happen.
I can&#39;t think of any other reasons as to why it would work.
I, like you, know way too many fat vegans.
Most people who claim that it improves health were either
malnutritioned of essential minerals prior to being a vegan
or have one of those freak of nature bodies.
I have also been there and done it.
I can confirm that it is simply superstition.
Much like a lot of other superstitious mumbo jumbo a lot of people who would be suckers for being vegan would believe in.
Astrology for example.</p>
<p>If it works for you, then great.
I&#39;d claim that it would work for you even if you didn&#39;t.
However, it most probably won&#39;t.
And don&#39;t damage your health permanently in some way by following weird diets.
My recommendation: eat everything. That includes vegetables.</p>
<p>My one rule for diets is no carbs. Works a lot better for my body than no fats
or no meat. But I break it religiously. Went for a holiday to Thailand recently.
Had mango sticky rice almost every day I was there. Contrary to a lot of popular
wisdom, I don&#39;t eat lean any more. My diet is full of fats.
My favourite dish is pork belly stuffed in eggplants.
I fry my vegetables in coconut oil and salted butter and angus fat and duck fat.
And I am as healthy as I&#39;ve ever been in the history of my health.</p>
<h3 id="Stop-Exercising"><a href="#Stop-Exercising" class="headerlink" title="Stop Exercising"></a>Stop Exercising</h3><p><strong>TLDR: exercise for improving health; not burning fat.</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever heard of fat burning exercises?
Every single treadmill I&#39;ve seen has a chart that shows a fat burning zone.
Apparently, if your heart rate is within a certain range, it will
burn fat instead of the glucose in your bloodstream and those stored in your liver.
Complete utter non-sense.</p>
<p>I did these fat burning exercises for years expecting them to reduce my waistline.
They never worked.
Also, don&#39;t think that just by gaining a little bit of muscle though
exercising, you are gonna magically lose all your fats.
If you have weight problems, chances are that your gains won&#39;t even be visible.
Soon, you will go back to blaming your genes and start avoiding your non obese
friends to make yourself try to feel better.</p>
<p>If you are gonna exercise, do it for the right reasons.
Those are: improving strength/flexibility/speed/endurance/bone density etc.
Those can improve the quality of your life even if you are fat.
But don&#39;t do it for burning fat. Why? Because 99.99% of fat gains/losses are due to nutrition.
I&#39;ve heard bs like muscles will help you metabolise more energy and hence help burn fat.
Unless you have muscles the size of Arnold and adjusted eating, I&#39;d say not so much.
Exercising can greatly enhance your fat loss efforts if your eating behaviour is correct.
However, if you are doing the same old thing, exercising won&#39;t help much.
In fact, if you are overweight, you are more likely to injure yourself exercising.
So before you turn your fat down to a safe range, you probably shouldn&#39;t get too crazy.</p>
<h3 id="Eliminate-Stress"><a href="#Eliminate-Stress" class="headerlink" title="Eliminate Stress"></a>Eliminate Stress</h3><p>This one should be a no brainer.
Stress adversely affects your health.
I&#39;ve heard things like stress turns your body alkaline and increases your natural insulin level.
I don&#39;t know. I am not a doctor.
However, I have observed that stress causes me lose sleep.
And losing sleep makes me hungry.</p>
<h3 id="Control-Eating-Times"><a href="#Control-Eating-Times" class="headerlink" title="Control Eating Times"></a>Control Eating Times</h3><p><strong>TLDR: Eat Less Often</strong></p>
<p>If you have weight problems, there is a very good chance that you eat too much
too often. The former here is less of a problem than the latter.
Instead of going on crazy low calorie diets, or restricting the types of food you eat,
simply reduce the number of times a day you eat and see what happens.</p>
<p>If you are fat, you probably have developed insulin resistance.
Every time you eat, your body releases insulin.
This is a hormone whose job it is to stop burning
fat and storing glucose in bloodstream as fat.
Think of it as a relay that governs whether you gain or lose fat.
Ask your doctor if you can burn fat while you have insulin in your body.
The answer he will give you is a big fat NO.
Other than not being able to burn fat when this hormone is present,
nothing good is ever associated prolonged levels of insulin in your body.
Things commonly discussed are some cancers, bad skin etc.
You also get to develop insulin resistance.
This is where your body ends up releasing a lot more insulin
than necessary and causes your body to store a lot more fat.
This eventually leads to type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>In the west, people usually have three meals a day: breakfast, lunch and dinner.
People who are fat usually also have snacks in between.
There is a &quot;sugar&quot; culture here in Australia where people think that
you need a constant supply of energy and nutrients through eating
in your body for it to work.
Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>This comes from taking a inorganic/washing machine view to
human body.
A washing machine can not operate without a constant supply of energy.
However, human body does not quite work the same way.
Your body is a lot smarter than the doctors and nutritionists
who think this way.
Your body stores energy and essential nutrients it needs
in its storage in case you run low.
If you stop eating and drinking, it will probably take you over a week
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">before you die</a>.
If you have access to water and essential minerals, it will be months before you die
from starvation.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: before the agricultural revolution, humans did not have
constant supply of food.
People went through periods of feast and famine.
How did they survive?
We evolved to not live on 2 fruits and 5 vegetables a day.
When you start living on 2 fruits and 5 vegetables a day, you start
to have developed world diseases like cancer and diabetes.
I will confess to not having had a slice of fruit in over a month and I am fine.
We will go more into that in controlling what you eat. However, the first step
and the most beneficial one is controlling how often you eat.</p>
<p>Eat as much as you think you need but at the very least, reduce your eating times
to 3 meals a day.
Without reducing the amount of food you eat, there are a few ways to further
improving insulin issues:</p>
<p>First one is to reduce the number of meals.
Unless you are 12, breakfast is probably not the most important meal of the day.
If you are not hungry, skip it.
There is no medical basis for the western 3 meal eating pattern.
Your body will store everything it needs for days and months.
Instead of eating more often, eat more when you are hungry.</p>
<p>Second is reducing eating times to a certain number of hours a day.
There is the famous fast 5 diet when all the eating of the day is done
within a 5 hour window in the day. I&#39;ve seen
versions where the eating window is 8 hours or less than 5 hours.
The principle is the same.
What you need to know about these diets is that they work like magic.
It restricts the times of a day where there is insulin in your blood
stream to a few hours.
It probably slowly reverses insulin resistance.
I&#39;ve also observed that effect of alcohol and other medication
increases when you are doing this form of diets.</p>
<p>Third, I&#39;ve also read that regular exercising lowers insulin levels in your body.
I have yet to experiment with it but it seems plausible.
Exercising would lower blood glucose.
It would not make sense for the body to have high levels of insulin then.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you are going to restrict the amount of times you eat
or skip a meal, the best one to do is the one before sleep.
During the first cycle of deep sleep, your body releases a lot of growth
hormone.
That helps your body grow, perform essential repairs and improve skin etc.
It is the largest fat burning hormone out there.
Effect of that greatly lessens if you have high levels of insulin in your body
at the time.
If you want better health, have dinner a couple of hours you go to bed.
Instead of snacking before bed, eat more during dinner.
Add some essential fats to your food.
It&#39;ll make you less hungry.</p>
<h3 id="Control-What-Type-Of-Food-You-Eat"><a href="#Control-What-Type-Of-Food-You-Eat" class="headerlink" title="Control What Type Of Food You Eat"></a>Control What Type Of Food You Eat</h3><p><strong> TLDR: remove bad carbohydrates from diet; start consuming fats </strong></p>
<p>This section is for you if you have come as far as you can by eating less times a day.
If you think that you have reached some kind of stasis with your body fat percentage
with eating only once a day and you feel like you are still unhealthy.
Well, it is time to start experimenting with food types.
Most people will not need to come this far.
But if you do, this is what will work:</p>
<p>You will never have these foods again: sugar, anything
with fructose, simple/starchy carbohydrates. Seriously.</p>
<p>First, if you are gonna do this properly, no sugar means absolutely no sugar.
It means no brown sugar. It means no honey.
There is absolutely no reason to have refined sugar.
If you need to sweeten, go for artificial sweeteners.
Yes some of the artificial sweeteners may have temporary adverse effects,
e.g. cause diphtheria, when consumed in large quantities.
Even if that happened, it is probably a
very small price to pay if you really want to have that cake and don&#39;t
want to stab yourself in the eye afterwards.
That is, only if you think you want to come this far.
I don&#39;t. But I have experimented with it. And I know that it works.
So far, I haven&#39;t had a bad experience with Erythritol.
Although, be warned that these artificial sweetner
compounds are of different sizes to sucrose.
Taste aside, they will act differently to sugar.
So you may need to adjust you recipe when cooking with these.</p>
<p>Second, no fruits.
There is absolutely no reason to consume fruits.
Fruits have vitamin c? Veges have a lot more.
Fruits have potassium? Veges have a lot more.
Fruits have fibre? Veges have a lot more.
I think you get the pattern.
If you need conviencing, look up the chemical compound
for table sugar (sucrose) and look up the one for fruit sugar
(fructose).
You&#39;ll find to your shock that one is made of the other.
If sugar is bad, both are.</p>
<p>Third, avoid starchy carbohydrates.
No pasta - no rice - no brown rice - not even wholemeal bs.
You are most probably familiar with glycemic index (GI).
Nutritionists usually advise that lower GI food is good.
Yes, they are. It is because lower GI carbs are usually more complex,
more mineral rich that take longer for the body to absorb stuff out of.
That is - it provides energy for you longer.
It is probably true but there is also some BS here.
Your liver stores enough glycogen to last 2-3 days.
If you exercise heavily, you will still last over a day.
You don&#39;t need to eat low GI food for slow release of energy.
That part is BS.
Starchy carbohydrates are also foods we did not have
much of before the agricultural revolution.
I am not gonna sprout bullshit like eat in moderation.
If you need to come this far to get your health sorted then
your body needs extreme adjustments to get back to the right
track.
Avoid all these foods altogether.
They don&#39;t agree with your body.</p>
<p>What about Asians? They eat a lot of carbs. Well, what about them.
Check their latest national health stats.
As they adapt western eating habits more and more,
they are on their way to becoming just as unhealthy as the rest of us in terms of developed world diseases.
I&#39;ve read some BS article suggesting that apparently the Japanese
have some gene mutation that let them absorb carbohydrates more efficiently.
I don&#39;t know about that.
I am very used to seeing Japanese faces and they look just as fat and ugly to me
as all the other races in the world.</p>
<p>What to eat instead? If you are up to here, it is time to start burning fat.
There is only one condition that need to be fulfilled for burning fat:
Your liver&#39;s stored energy reserve must be empty.
Well there are two.
You need to not have insulin in your blood stream.
When it is empty and your body needs to use energy, it will start burning fat.
Best way to kick start into that state is doing some form of fasting where you
don&#39;t eat any food for 2-3 days. Exercising during this period
can speed up the process.
If you get that bad headache, it is due to your body losing water and sodium.
I usually start taking a cocktail of 98% water mixed with a little bit of salt, lime and apple cidar vinegar at this point.
You will usually feel nauseous when you start burning fat/ketones instead of glucose.
Napping will help.
There is a common misconception that your brain needs glucose to function.
It does not.
Your brain will be a lot sharper when you are burning ketones instead of glucose.
There will just initially be minor discomfort due to low energy and glucose withdrawal
when your body is switching over what it is burning.</p>
<p>Once you start burning fat, you will want to keep burning fat.
There is a lot of literature out there in ketogenic diet which you can follow.
Basically, there is a second scale called the insulin index which measures
how much insulin is released in response to the food you consume,
You want to consume food to keep insulin release in your body to
the bare minimum. Typically, you will consume a lot of fats, some good quality
vegetables and some protein.
It is important to not consume too much protein as the body can convert excess
protein into glucose which can increase insulin.
Consuming fats will also help you feel more full and stay full for longer.
Be careful as to not consume too much calories.
If you eat too much, you will still gain fat.</p>
<p>The other thing to keep in mind is that there is a limit to how much
fat you can burn in a day. It is tied to the release of growth hormone during
sleep and how much you breathe. When everything is running smoothly,
I&#39;ve experienced loosing up to 300-500grams of fat a day (not water weight or muscle).
If you want to measure how much fat you
are burning, you can get yourself a breath acetone meter which is a by product
of the fat burning process.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2017/12/24/2017-12-24/">Leadership Archetypes</a></h1>
	
	<div class="article__infos">
		<span class="article__date">2017-12-24</span><br />
		
		
	</div>

	

	
		<p>Earlier, I mentioned my favourite definition of leadership being something
along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>someone assumes a leadership role when someone decides there is a problem, a need or an injustice and takes action to solve the problem, fulfil the need or correct the injustice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this view, leadership archetypes are the different roles
people take in fulfilling a need or solving a problem or correcting an injustice.
There seems to be several schools of thoughts in terms of what these archetypes are.
I&#39;ll do my best consolidate some of the positive ones here:</p>
<h3 id="Teacher-Mentor-Coach"><a href="#Teacher-Mentor-Coach" class="headerlink" title="Teacher / Mentor / Coach"></a>Teacher / Mentor / Coach</h3><p>In fulfilling need for development, these are people who develop other people.
Maybe they have travelled the path before.
Maybe they have experimented with the subject matter or they have more experience.
Or maybe they are just good at coaching or keeping you motivated.</p>
<p>This requires a special kind of skill.
Being good at something does not automatically mean that someone are good at teaching/mentoring other people.
Also, being able to teach something to others does not necessary mean that someone is very good at that skill.
They don&#39;t have to be either.
Those are independent skills to acquire and are both very valuable.</p>
<p>In my experience, these people will talk to you about your goals and hopes
and dreams etc and will enable you in your development.</p>
<h4 id="Student-Mentee-Athlete"><a href="#Student-Mentee-Athlete" class="headerlink" title="Student / Mentee / Athlete"></a>Student / Mentee / Athlete</h4><p>This archetype/role is one that I think does not get mentioned in a lot of literature.
This is the exact opposite of the teacher/mentor role -
the proactive student who is in charge of their own development.</p>
<p>This person will go to you and ask you for your guidance and feedback.
He will ask you to be their mentor etc.</p>
<h4 id="Learners"><a href="#Learners" class="headerlink" title="Learners"></a>Learners</h4><p>There is a third configuration to this role which I think is the best one.
Teachers are greatly respected in every society.
If they are not, I think there is something wrong with that society.
However, I have also experienced instances where the status of the teacher
and the student can be equal and of mutual interest.</p>
<p>I think this happens naturally where the student and the teacher are both focused on improving.
They inspire each other and develop together through shared experiences.
You are comrades in your journey towards improvement.
I think we should be respectful and thankful to anyone who help us grow.
In turn, we should help out others where we can in their growth.</p>
<h3 id="Father-Judge-Manager-Processor"><a href="#Father-Judge-Manager-Processor" class="headerlink" title="Father / Judge / Manager / Processor"></a>Father / Judge / Manager / Processor</h3><p>In terms of getting things done, whether it be via planning and following
a plan or the other extreme of moving towards the general direction of solution,
you need people to &quot;provide oversight, control, moral guidance and caring
protection.&quot;
The main characteristic of this role is the ability to oversee others.
Make sure that they are moving in the right direction and that
their cats and dogs are happy.</p>
<p>The &quot;father&quot; terminology obviously comes from the traditional
image of a father figure some kind of patriarchal family setup.
If you think of your team, your department, your company etc as a family,
these are the people who will make sure that whatever direction
you&#39;re taking your family is not set for doom and make sure that you are
keeping track of your plan.
Some literature also add a creation or direction aspect to this role but I don&#39;t
want to conflate this role with some of the other I want to list whose main
focus is those activities.
My current interpretation of this archetype is a traditional/conservative
middle manager role/wizards of operation who make sure that everyone is happy
and everything is operating smoothly. They communicate and empathise. </p>
<p>I am not downplaying this role when I use words like traditional or
conservative.
This role is obviously one of the most important ones.
If everyone wanted to play the role of the visionary/entrepreneurial leader all
the time, nothing would ever get done.</p>
<p>When I think of someone in this architype, I think of an army leader.
I heard that in the US navy seals, the leader eats after everyone else.
In Sun Tzu&#39;s art of war, he tells the leader to regard their soldiers as children
so they may follow him to the ends of the earth.</p>
<h3 id="Warrior-Knight-Mercenary-Hero-Soldier-Engineer-Theif-Builder-Gambler"><a href="#Warrior-Knight-Mercenary-Hero-Soldier-Engineer-Theif-Builder-Gambler" class="headerlink" title="Warrior / Knight / Mercenary / Hero / Soldier / Engineer / Theif / Builder / Gambler"></a>Warrior / Knight / Mercenary / Hero / Soldier / Engineer / Theif / Builder / Gambler</h3><p>These are people who take risks and action during a crisis.
I&#39;ve lumped them together because they are very similar. However are sub-architypes within these.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can be a knight vs. a mercenary on the dimension of loyalty.</li>
<li>you can be a warrior/knight vs. shadow warrior/dark knight in terms of your regards for rules.</li>
<li>you can be a hero vs. a coward/bystander in terms of your decision to show courage/act independently.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, what is characteristic of these roles are their direct connection/contribution.
They are the doers. They have hold over life and death.
If this was the warring states period in Japan, they would be the Samurais.
If this was an R&amp;D firm, they would be the scientists and engineers.
If this was a car dealership, they would be the salespeople.
I&#39;d put someone who is really good at making deals into this category.
They take leadership position when they decide to act in response
to some need.
They are also characterised due to the direct risk they take.
Whether it is in the modern era in terms of their time or in the distant past in
terms of their lives.</p>
<p>This one is probably hardest to grasp for most people. But it is not incomprehensible.
Think of a modern R&amp;D organisation. Who are the leaders there? Is it the
sponsors who provide research funds? Is it their CEO who provides visions
that are vague enough to mean anything? We certainly pay him the most.
Is it the middle managers who divide up the funding between their teams?
They certainly like to do all the hiring and firing.
Or is it the researchers and scientists who tinker with things day and night to
produce the actual results?
If you ask me, it is either all of them or none of them.
If you still don&#39;t get it, let&#39;s play a game I like to call: &quot;take it out and see.&quot;
Which of the roles explained here can you take out and things would still
function? Say we fired the CEO or all the middle managers or all the scientists or all the engineers?
Would things still function?
You&#39;ll find that the CEO&#39;s leadership role is the least important one.</p>
<h4 id="Strategist-Tactician-Schemer-Spy"><a href="#Strategist-Tactician-Schemer-Spy" class="headerlink" title="Strategist / Tactician / Schemer / Spy"></a>Strategist / Tactician / Schemer / Spy</h4><p>This is sub-archetype I see that is as important as the Warrior archetype.
People in these roles are usually accomplished warriors/knights or have equivalent knowledge
to be able to operate at a meta level to maximise their goals.</p>
<p>There are multiple levels of this. There is the high level strategy.
Things like &quot;we will be customer first&quot; and &quot;we will be a collaboration hub&quot; for example.</p>
<p>However, there is also lower level of strategy that is much more useful/closer to real life.
Some call it tactics or still lump it with strategy.
For example, &quot;we will use this architecture&quot; or &quot;lets invest into to find a better solution for this&quot; or &quot;let&#39;s target this market with this product.&quot;
It is when you know what you can do and how things may turn out and cleverly take
practical steps to reach a more favourable outcome.</p>
<p>For example, something may be ordinarily not possible.
But someone may decide &quot;if we were a little bit clever and did this instead, it could work&quot; and experiment.
And it may lead to a more successful outcome. Or it may not work.
And you may learn that and come one step closer to solving that problem.
The strategist sub-archetype here would correspond to the being clever part.
Rest, I&#39;d put under the visionary archetype.</p>
<h3 id="Visionary-Alchemist"><a href="#Visionary-Alchemist" class="headerlink" title="Visionary / Alchemist"></a>Visionary / Alchemist</h3><p>Someone who imagines possibilities and guides/acts towards bringing them to reality.
I suppose this person is one level above the person who comes up ideas and seeks validation based on it.
They act on turning their ideas into reality.</p>
<p>I suppose you&#39;d put someone like Steve Jobs into this category.
Personally, when I think of a visionary, someone like Einstein or Turing comes to mind.
They did not just come up with ideas.
They went with their ideas. They contributed enough to leave their name in history books.
Probably a high bar to follow for someone from the modern era like Steve Jobs.
I am sure he did he best.</p>
<p>I&#39;d put someone like an entrepreneur in this category.
Maybe someone had a clever business idea.
They went with it. Succeeded or not, they tried to be a leader by trying to make
it happen.</p>
<p>I sometimes put some of my time into a hackathon called random hacks of kindness.
There, individuals called &quot;change makers&quot; pitch ideas for some kind of cause
and usually over a weekend, some hackers get together to build a system or something
that helps further the cause. I&#39;d say those &quot;change makers&quot; are also excellent
examples of this archetypes.</p>
<h4 id="Revolutionary-Crusader"><a href="#Revolutionary-Crusader" class="headerlink" title="Revolutionary / Crusader"></a>Revolutionary / Crusader</h4><p>I see them as a sub-archetype. They are the same as Visionaries.
They differ in that their vision conflicts with status quo / established order.</p>
<h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>There are plenty others. But those I believe are the main ones.
People lead by a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing others,</li>
<li>providing oversight,</li>
<li>contributing time and skills, and</li>
<li>acting on their vision</li>
</ul>
<p>in solving a problem, fulfilling a need or correcting some injustice.</p>
