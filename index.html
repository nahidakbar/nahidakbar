		<p>Disclaimer: This article is for you if you are an adult and
conventional wisdom has not been working for you in keeping
you within healthy weight range.
I am not a Doctor.
I just like to play one in the internet.
The advise I&#39;ll give here may conflict with official ones.
Follow at your own risk.
That being said, the advise I&#39;ll give here are the ones that work for me.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve never had a weight problem growing up.
I grew up on high carb diet living on refined sugar.
I refused to eat anything else.
Before my teens. my default meal would be something
along the lines of rice, milk and sugar mixed with some
kind of fruit (like banana or mango).
I ate that every day of my life for years.
If I ate like that now, I&#39;ll probably kill myself within
a year.
However, I was not overweight.
In fact, I was very very skinny.
I as was as skinny as children of my age group get.
Weight and food weren&#39;t things on my mind.
Someone else was always responsible for feeding me.
I was fed breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t much of a problem during my teens either.
My diet did not change all that well.
I started to appreciate some of the other tastes
like umami that comes from meat and pasta and
sour foods and other fruits etc.
I was a little bit over weight but it was not a problem.
I was growing.
I growing a lot more than I was widening.
Weight was not in my mind back then but food probably was.
I ate and I ate.
There was nothing else to to do but to study and to eat.
Perks of having asian parents.</p>
<p>It started becoming a problem when I was an adult.
This was after I had stopped growing.
I started widening instead.
It was early 20s.
I didn&#39;t think of much of it at the time.
I was eating to the recommended guidelines.
The 2 fruit and 5 vegetable crap.
I was away from home then to attend university in Sydney.
I was eating out with friends.
I started drinking around then.
I was having sugary soda with every meal.
I started drinking coffee.
These were the fashionable things to do.</p>
<p>I started taking it seriously one afternoon.
I was struck with sudden chest pain.
I could not stand or walk.
It hurt.
It was bad.
I seriously thought I was gonna die.
I went to a doctor.
He laughed.
He told me to diet and exercise.
Those were foreign words to me.
I had to google up what he meant by diet.</p>
<p>Fast forward 10 years, I am still alive.
I don&#39;t have chest pains any more.
I managed to pick up a sport.
Something I really like.
I go to gym.
I diet from time to time.
I think I have a very good handle over my health now.
But, reflecting on what I do now, I did not always do what I do now.
I researched and followed a lot of advise that did not work for me.
Things written in diet and nutrition websites and fitness magazines.
If you can relate to being in the same boat, this post is for you.
Tips I&#39;ll give here are ones that I&#39;ve found to better my health.
I&#39;ll discuss tips for making the most extreme of diets work.
I&#39;ll also discuss the ones that will make them not required.
Here they are:</p>
<h3 id="Forget-Weight-Management"><a href="#Forget-Weight-Management" class="headerlink" title="Forget Weight Management"></a>Forget Weight Management</h3><p><strong>TLDR: Forget weight management! Track body fat percentage/kilograms
instead.
20% or under is probably a healthy body fat target for both
males and females.</strong></p>
<p>First couple of tips are related to getting your facts straight.
There is a lot of misinformation out there.
Perhaps misinformation is not the right word to use here.
I am sure they work for some people
For those people, no matter what they do, they will probably stay healthy.
Maybe they genetically gifted or are some other kind of freak of nature.
Maybe they do something else that prevents them from gaining weight.
Important thing is that, since these advises do not work for you, you get to stop following them.
The biggest bs I&#39;ve encountered is the weight myth.</p>
<p>There is something called the BMI.
Given your height, it will spit out a healthy weight range for you to
be in.
If you are above it, you need to lose some weight.
If you are below it, you need to gain some.
It is the biggest load of crap out there. Here is why:</p>
<p>First, weight does not matter.
Pick someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger for example.
He is he is probably a freak of nature. But he is an important freak of nature.
His height is 188cm.
According to official guidelines, his weight should be 53.5 - 72kg for him to be healthy.
How much does he weight? 107 kg.
According to official guidelines, he is above and beyond obese.</p>
<p>Is he though?
No chance in hell. He probably still has over 72 kilos of pure muscle
and dense bones despite being 70 now. I am not asking you to become a body
builder.
However, those are things that you want to have to improve your immune system and
for good ageing.
If you are sick all the time from trivial diseases, try making your bones more dense your bones with some high impact training.
Will work a lot better than prescription drugs.
Also, if you don&#39;t want to curl up into a weak old man by the time you are 40,
put some time into gym every once in a while or pick up some kind of sport.
This is especially important if you have a desk job like mine.</p>
<p>Second, some weights just don&#39;t matter.
I can, for example, go on a yoyo diet right now.
I will probably lose 1-2 kg a day over the next few days until I exhaust my
mental strength or die from dehydration.
How? My body will lose slowly sodium and other important minerals
and I will lose a lot of water weight.
Once I start eating, I will gain back my weight almost immediately.
What was the point of this exercise?
Nothing at all.
Did your waistline shrink? Nope.
Most people give up long before their liver runs out of stored glucose
and their body actually adapts to burning fat.
No improvement of health.
Most people who diet a little bit here or there never do.
They learn hate themselves in the process and blame their genes.</p>
<p>Does it mean that we should not keep track of our health?
Absolutely not.
If you have nothing better to track, measure you weight.
That is your MVP.
If you eat bullshit written in official guidelines, don&#39;t exercise and live a sedantary lifestyle,
the BMI guide is probably as good as any.</p>
<p>However, if you care about your health and exercise or play some kind of sport,
upgrade your measurement to this number: your body fat percentage.
If you like a measurement in kilograms, convert that number into
the number of kilograms of fat your body has.
It is the only fitness number that matters.</p>
<p>Why? if you have a lot of fat in your body, you probably also have a fatty liver.
And you are probably at the risk of what doctors refer to as weight related diseases.
And other than muscle and bone density, that is the difference between
a regular old 70 year old fat man and someone like Arnold.
He has a very low body fat content which highlights his body&#39;s definition
and makes him look younger. Here is a visual guide for your reference:</p>
<p><figure class="figure"><img src="/contents/2017-12-26/body-fat-percentage.jpg" alt=""></figure></p>
<p>Also, for the yoyo diet example, when you lose 5kgs of water weight
and feel like stabbing yourself in the eye in the process,
you learn to not repeat such exercises in futility when you measure
the right metrics.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to measure this. There are calipers, DEXA scans,
biometric scales. I personally don&#39;t recommend invasive techniques
like DEXA. Although, it is probably the most accurate measure,
you are practically X-raying your body every time you
want to get a measure. I like to save that kind of radiation
exposure for special occasions like when I break a leg or something.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t measure, you are practically in the dark.
If you are not in control with accurate measurements,
you&#39;ll easily full yourself with shit advise written in
nutritionist websites and fitness magazines.
Don&#39;t waste your time.
Start measuring.
Experiment with your food and your body and your
exercises.
See what works for you and follow them.
Don&#39;t do things that does not work for you.
The other part is, once you start making the right kind of progress, nothing will motivate you and help you stay on track than yourself seeing your own progress.
It works a lot better than telling all your friends about it.</p>
<h3 id="Stop-Being-A-Vegan"><a href="#Stop-Being-A-Vegan" class="headerlink" title="Stop Being A Vegan"></a>Stop Being A Vegan</h3><p>Have you ever tried to be a vegetarian or vegan for improving health?
Chances are that you have that thin/attractive friend
who claims that their health is attributed to being a vegan.</p>
<p>I am not gonna deny it.
You could probably lose weight by being a vegan if your body
became malfunctioned in a way for that to happen.
I can&#39;t think of any other reasons as to why it would work.
I, like you, know way too many fat vegans.
Most people who claim that it improves health were either
malnutritioned of essential minerals prior to being a vegan
or have one of those freak of nature bodies.
I have also been there and done it.
I can confirm that it is simply superstition.
Much like a lot of other superstitious mumbo jumbo a lot of people who would be suckers for being vegan would believe in.
Astrology for example.</p>
<p>If it works for you, then great.
I&#39;d claim that it would work for you even if you didn&#39;t.
However, it most probably won&#39;t.
And don&#39;t damage your health permanently in some way by following weird diets.
My recommendation: eat everything. That includes vegetables.</p>
<p>My one rule for diets is no carbs. Works a lot better for my body than no fats
or no meat. But I break it religiously. Went for a holiday to Thailand recently.
Had mango sticky rice almost every day I was there. Contrary to a lot of popular
wisdom, I don&#39;t eat lean any more. My diet is full of fats.
My favourite dish is pork belly stuffed in eggplants.
I fry my vegetables in coconut oil and salted butter and angus fat and duck fat.
And I am as healthy as I&#39;ve ever been in the history of my health.</p>
<h3 id="Stop-Exercising"><a href="#Stop-Exercising" class="headerlink" title="Stop Exercising"></a>Stop Exercising</h3><p><strong>TLDR: exercise for improving health; not burning fat.</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever heard of fat burning exercises?
Every single treadmill I&#39;ve seen has a chart that shows a fat burning zone.
Apparently, if your heart rate is within a certain range, it will
burn fat instead of the glucose in your bloodstream and those stored in your liver.
Complete utter non-sense.</p>
<p>I did these fat burning exercises for years expecting them to reduce my waistline.
They never worked.
Also, don&#39;t think that just by gaining a little bit of muscle though
exercising, you are gonna magically lose all your fats.
If you have weight problems, chances are that your gains won&#39;t even be visible.
Soon, you will go back to blaming your genes and start avoiding your non obese
friends to make yourself try to feel better.</p>
<p>If you are gonna exercise, do it for the right reasons.
Those are: improving strength/flexibility/speed/endurance/bone density etc.
Those can improve the quality of your life even if you are fat.
But don&#39;t do it for burning fat. Why? Because 99.99% of fat gains/losses are due to nutrition.
I&#39;ve heard bs like muscles will help you metabolise more energy and hence help burn fat.
Unless you have muscles the size of Arnold and adjusted eating, I&#39;d say not so much.
Exercising can greatly enhance your fat loss efforts if your eating behaviour is correct.
However, if you are doing the same old thing, exercising won&#39;t help much.
In fact, if you are overweight, you are more likely to injure yourself exercising.
So before you turn your fat down to a safe range, you probably shouldn&#39;t get too crazy.</p>
<h3 id="Eliminate-Stress"><a href="#Eliminate-Stress" class="headerlink" title="Eliminate Stress"></a>Eliminate Stress</h3><p>This one should be a no brainer.
Stress adversely affects your health.
I&#39;ve heard things like stress turns your body alkaline and increases your natural insulin level.
I don&#39;t know. I am not a doctor.
However, I have observed that stress causes me lose sleep.
And losing sleep makes me hungry.</p>
<h3 id="Control-Eating-Times"><a href="#Control-Eating-Times" class="headerlink" title="Control Eating Times"></a>Control Eating Times</h3><p><strong>TLDR: Eat Less Often</strong></p>
<p>If you have weight problems, there is a very good chance that you eat too much
too often. The former here is less of a problem than the latter.
Instead of going on crazy low calorie diets, or restricting the types of food you eat,
simply reduce the number of times a day you eat and see what happens.</p>
<p>If you are fat, you probably have developed insulin resistance.
Every time you eat, your body releases insulin.
This is a hormone whose job it is to stop burning
fat and storing glucose in bloodstream as fat.
Think of it as a relay that governs whether you gain or lose fat.
Ask your doctor if you can burn fat while you have insulin in your body.
The answer he will give you is a big fat NO.
Other than not being able to burn fat when this hormone is present,
nothing good is ever associated prolonged levels of insulin in your body.
Things commonly discussed are some cancers, bad skin etc.
You also get to develop insulin resistance.
This is where your body ends up releasing a lot more insulin
than necessary and causes your body to store a lot more fat.
This eventually leads to type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>In the west, people usually have three meals a day: breakfast, lunch and dinner.
People who are fat usually also have snacks in between.
There is a &quot;sugar&quot; culture here in Australia where people think that
you need a constant supply of energy and nutrients through eating
in your body for it to work.
Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>This comes from taking a inorganic/washing machine view to
human body.
A washing machine can not operate without a constant supply of energy.
However, human body does not quite work the same way.
Your body is a lot smarter than the doctors and nutritionists
who think this way.
Your body stores energy and essential nutrients it needs
in its storage in case you run low.
If you stop eating and drinking, it will probably take you over a week
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">before you die</a>.
If you have access to water and essential minerals, it will be months before you die
from starvation.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: before the agricultural revolution, humans did not have
constant supply of food.
People went through periods of feast and famine.
How did they survive?
We evolved to not live on 2 fruits and 5 vegetables a day.
When you start living on 2 fruits and 5 vegetables a day, you start
to have developed world diseases like cancer and diabetes.
I will confess to not having had a slice of fruit in over a month and I am fine.
We will go more into that in controlling what you eat. However, the first step
and the most beneficial one is controlling how often you eat.</p>
<p>Eat as much as you think you need but at the very least, reduce your eating times
to 3 meals a day.
Without reducing the amount of food you eat, there are a few ways to further
improving insulin issues:</p>
<p>First one is to reduce the number of meals.
Unless you are 12, breakfast is probably not the most important meal of the day.
If you are not hungry, skip it.
There is no medical basis for the western 3 meal eating pattern.
Your body will store everything it needs for days and months.
Instead of eating more often, eat more when you are hungry.</p>
<p>Second is reducing eating times to a certain number of hours a day.
There is the famous fast 5 diet when all the eating of the day is done
within a 5 hour window in the day. I&#39;ve seen
versions where the eating window is 8 hours or less than 5 hours.
The principle is the same.
What you need to know about these diets is that they work like magic.
It restricts the times of a day where there is insulin in your blood
stream to a few hours.
It probably slowly reverses insulin resistance.
I&#39;ve also observed that effect of alcohol and other medication
increases when you are doing this form of diets.</p>
<p>Third, I&#39;ve also read that regular exercising lowers insulin levels in your body.
I have yet to experiment with it but it seems plausible.
Exercising would lower blood glucose.
It would not make sense for the body to have high levels of insulin then.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you are going to restrict the amount of times you eat
or skip a meal, the best one to do is the one before sleep.
During the first cycle of deep sleep, your body releases a lot of growth
hormone.
That helps your body grow, perform essential repairs and improve skin etc.
It is the largest fat burning hormone out there.
Effect of that greatly lessens if you have high levels of insulin in your body
at the time.
If you want better health, have dinner a couple of hours you go to bed.
Instead of snacking before bed, eat more during dinner.
Add some essential fats to your food.
It&#39;ll make you less hungry.</p>
<h3 id="Control-What-Type-Of-Food-You-Eat"><a href="#Control-What-Type-Of-Food-You-Eat" class="headerlink" title="Control What Type Of Food You Eat"></a>Control What Type Of Food You Eat</h3><p><strong> TLDR: remove bad carbohydrates from diet; start consuming fats </strong></p>
<p>This section is for you if you have come as far as you can by eating less times a day.
If you think that you have reached some kind of stasis with your body fat percentage
with eating only once a day and you feel like you are still unhealthy.
Well, it is time to start experimenting with food types.
Most people will not need to come this far.
But if you do, this is what will work:</p>
<p>You will never have these foods again: sugar, anything
with fructose, simple/starchy carbohydrates. Seriously.</p>
<p>First, if you are gonna do this properly, no sugar means absolutely no sugar.
It means no brown sugar. It means no honey.
There is absolutely no reason to have refined sugar.
If you need to sweeten, go for artificial sweeteners.
Yes some of the artificial sweeteners may have temporary adverse effects,
e.g. cause diphtheria, when consumed in large quantities.
Even if that happened, it is probably a
very small price to pay if you really want to have that cake and don&#39;t
want to stab yourself in the eye afterwards.
That is, only if you think you want to come this far.
I don&#39;t. But I have experimented with it. And I know that it works.
So far, I haven&#39;t had a bad experience with Erythritol.
Although, be warned that these artificial sweetner
compounds are of different sizes to sucrose.
Taste aside, they will act differently to sugar.
So you may need to adjust you recipe when cooking with these.</p>
<p>Second, no fruits.
There is absolutely no reason to consume fruits.
Fruits have vitamin c? Veges have a lot more.
Fruits have potassium? Veges have a lot more.
Fruits have fibre? Veges have a lot more.
I think you get the pattern.
If you need conviencing, look up the chemical compound
for table sugar (sucrose) and look up the one for fruit sugar
(fructose).
You&#39;ll find to your shock that one is made of the other.
If sugar is bad, both are.</p>
<p>Third, avoid starchy carbohydrates.
No pasta - no rice - no brown rice - not even wholemeal bs.
You are most probably familiar with glycemic index (GI).
Nutritionists usually advise that lower GI food is good.
Yes, they are. It is because lower GI carbs are usually more complex,
more mineral rich that take longer for the body to absorb stuff out of.
That is - it provides energy for you longer.
It is probably true but there is also some BS here.
Your liver stores enough glycogen to last 2-3 days.
If you exercise heavily, you will still last over a day.
You don&#39;t need to eat low GI food for slow release of energy.
That part is BS.
Starchy carbohydrates are also foods we did not have
much of before the agricultural revolution.
I am not gonna sprout bullshit like eat in moderation.
If you need to come this far to get your health sorted then
your body needs extreme adjustments to get back to the right
track.
Avoid all these foods altogether.
They don&#39;t agree with your body.</p>
<p>What about Asians? They eat a lot of carbs. Well, what about them.
Check their latest national health stats.
As they adapt western eating habits more and more,
they are on their way to becoming just as unhealthy as the rest of us in terms of developed world diseases.
I&#39;ve read some BS article suggesting that apparently the Japanese
have some gene mutation that let them absorb carbohydrates more efficiently.
I don&#39;t know about that.
I am very used to seeing Japanese faces and they look just as fat and ugly to me
as all the other races in the world.</p>
<p>What to eat instead? If you are up to here, it is time to start burning fat.
There is only one condition that need to be fulfilled for burning fat:
Your liver&#39;s stored energy reserve must be empty.
Well there are two.
You need to not have insulin in your blood stream.
When it is empty and your body needs to use energy, it will start burning fat.
Best way to kick start into that state is doing some form of fasting where you
don&#39;t eat any food for 2-3 days. Exercising during this period
can speed up the process.
If you get that bad headache, it is due to your body losing water and sodium.
I usually start taking a cocktail of 98% water mixed with a little bit of salt, lime and apple cidar vinegar at this point.
You will usually feel nauseous when you start burning fat/ketones instead of glucose.
Napping will help.
There is a common misconception that your brain needs glucose to function.
It does not.
Your brain will be a lot sharper when you are burning ketones instead of glucose.
There will just initially be minor discomfort due to low energy and glucose withdrawal
when your body is switching over what it is burning.</p>
<p>Once you start burning fat, you will want to keep burning fat.
There is a lot of literature out there in ketogenic diet which you can follow.
Basically, there is a second scale called the insulin index which measures
how much insulin is released in response to the food you consume,
You want to consume food to keep insulin release in your body to
the bare minimum. Typically, you will consume a lot of fats, some good quality
vegetables and some protein.
It is important to not consume too much protein as the body can convert excess
protein into glucose which can increase insulin.
Consuming fats will also help you feel more full and stay full for longer.
Be careful as to not consume too much calories.
If you eat too much, you will still gain fat.</p>
<p>The other thing to keep in mind is that there is a limit to how much
fat you can burn in a day. It is tied to the release of growth hormone during
sleep and how much you breathe. When everything is running smoothly,
I&#39;ve experienced loosing up to 300-500grams of fat a day (not water weight or muscle).
If you want to measure how much fat you
are burning, you can get yourself a breath acetone meter which is a by product
of the fat burning process.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2017/12/24/2017-12-24/">Leadership Archetypes</a></h1>
	
	<div class="article__infos">
		<span class="article__date">2017-12-24</span><br />
		
		
	</div>

	

	
		<p>Earlier, I mentioned my favourite definition of leadership being something
along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>someone assumes a leadership role when someone decides there is a problem, a need or an injustice and takes action to solve the problem, fulfil the need or correct the injustice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this view, leadership archetypes are the different roles
people take in fulfilling a need or solving a problem or correcting an injustice.
There seems to be several schools of thoughts in terms of what these archetypes are.
I&#39;ll do my best consolidate some of the positive ones here:</p>
<h3 id="Teacher-Mentor-Coach"><a href="#Teacher-Mentor-Coach" class="headerlink" title="Teacher / Mentor / Coach"></a>Teacher / Mentor / Coach</h3><p>In fulfilling need for development, these are people who develop other people.
Maybe they have travelled the path before.
Maybe they have experimented with the subject matter or they have more experience.
Or maybe they are just good at coaching or keeping you motivated.</p>
<p>This requires a special kind of skill.
Being good at something does not automatically mean that someone are good at teaching/mentoring other people.
Also, being able to teach something to others does not necessary mean that someone is very good at that skill.
They don&#39;t have to be either.
Those are independent skills to acquire and are both very valuable.</p>
<p>In my experience, these people will talk to you about your goals and hopes
and dreams etc and will enable you in your development.</p>
<h4 id="Student-Mentee-Athlete"><a href="#Student-Mentee-Athlete" class="headerlink" title="Student / Mentee / Athlete"></a>Student / Mentee / Athlete</h4><p>This archetype/role is one that I think does not get mentioned in a lot of literature.
This is the exact opposite of the teacher/mentor role -
the proactive student who is in charge of their own development.</p>
<p>This person will go to you and ask you for your guidance and feedback.
He will ask you to be their mentor etc.</p>
<h4 id="Learners"><a href="#Learners" class="headerlink" title="Learners"></a>Learners</h4><p>There is a third configuration to this role which I think is the best one.
Teachers are greatly respected in every society.
If they are not, I think there is something wrong with that society.
However, I have also experienced instances where the status of the teacher
and the student can be equal and of mutual interest.</p>
<p>I think this happens naturally where the student and the teacher are both focused on improving.
They inspire each other and develop together through shared experiences.
You are comrades in your journey towards improvement.
I think we should be respectful and thankful to anyone who help us grow.
In turn, we should help out others where we can in their growth.</p>
<h3 id="Father-Judge-Manager-Processor"><a href="#Father-Judge-Manager-Processor" class="headerlink" title="Father / Judge / Manager / Processor"></a>Father / Judge / Manager / Processor</h3><p>In terms of getting things done, whether it be via planning and following
a plan or the other extreme of moving towards the general direction of solution,
you need people to &quot;provide oversight, control, moral guidance and caring
protection.&quot;
The main characteristic of this role is the ability to oversee others.
Make sure that they are moving in the right direction and that
their cats and dogs are happy.</p>
<p>The &quot;father&quot; terminology obviously comes from the traditional
image of a father figure some kind of patriarchal family setup.
If you think of your team, your department, your company etc as a family,
these are the people who will make sure that whatever direction
you&#39;re taking your family is not set for doom and make sure that you are
keeping track of your plan.
Some literature also add a creation or direction aspect to this role but I don&#39;t
want to conflate this role with some of the other I want to list whose main
focus is those activities.
My current interpretation of this archetype is a traditional/conservative
middle manager role/wizards of operation who make sure that everyone is happy
and everything is operating smoothly. They communicate and empathise. </p>
<p>I am not downplaying this role when I use words like traditional or
conservative.
This role is obviously one of the most important ones.
If everyone wanted to play the role of the visionary/entrepreneurial leader all
the time, nothing would ever get done.</p>
<p>When I think of someone in this architype, I think of an army leader.
I heard that in the US navy seals, the leader eats after everyone else.
In Sun Tzu&#39;s art of war, he tells the leader to regard their soldiers as children
so they may follow him to the ends of the earth.</p>
<h3 id="Warrior-Knight-Mercenary-Hero-Soldier-Engineer-Theif-Builder-Gambler"><a href="#Warrior-Knight-Mercenary-Hero-Soldier-Engineer-Theif-Builder-Gambler" class="headerlink" title="Warrior / Knight / Mercenary / Hero / Soldier / Engineer / Theif / Builder / Gambler"></a>Warrior / Knight / Mercenary / Hero / Soldier / Engineer / Theif / Builder / Gambler</h3><p>These are people who take risks and action during a crisis.
I&#39;ve lumped them together because they are very similar. However are sub-architypes within these.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can be a knight vs. a mercenary on the dimension of loyalty.</li>
<li>you can be a warrior/knight vs. shadow warrior/dark knight in terms of your regards for rules.</li>
<li>you can be a hero vs. a coward/bystander in terms of your decision to show courage/act independently.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, what is characteristic of these roles are their direct connection/contribution.
They are the doers. They have hold over life and death.
If this was the warring states period in Japan, they would be the Samurais.
If this was an R&amp;D firm, they would be the scientists and engineers.
If this was a car dealership, they would be the salespeople.
I&#39;d put someone who is really good at making deals into this category.
They take leadership position when they decide to act in response
to some need.
They are also characterised due to the direct risk they take.
Whether it is in the modern era in terms of their time or in the distant past in
terms of their lives.</p>
<p>This one is probably hardest to grasp for most people. But it is not incomprehensible.
Think of a modern R&amp;D organisation. Who are the leaders there? Is it the
sponsors who provide research funds? Is it their CEO who provides visions
that are vague enough to mean anything? We certainly pay him the most.
Is it the middle managers who divide up the funding between their teams?
They certainly like to do all the hiring and firing.
Or is it the researchers and scientists who tinker with things day and night to
produce the actual results?
If you ask me, it is either all of them or none of them.
If you still don&#39;t get it, let&#39;s play a game I like to call: &quot;take it out and see.&quot;
Which of the roles explained here can you take out and things would still
function? Say we fired the CEO or all the middle managers or all the scientists or all the engineers?
Would things still function?
You&#39;ll find that the CEO&#39;s leadership role is the least important one.</p>
<h4 id="Strategist-Tactician-Schemer-Spy"><a href="#Strategist-Tactician-Schemer-Spy" class="headerlink" title="Strategist / Tactician / Schemer / Spy"></a>Strategist / Tactician / Schemer / Spy</h4><p>This is sub-archetype I see that is as important as the Warrior archetype.
People in these roles are usually accomplished warriors/knights or have equivalent knowledge
to be able to operate at a meta level to maximise their goals.</p>
<p>There are multiple levels of this. There is the high level strategy.
Things like &quot;we will be customer first&quot; and &quot;we will be a collaboration hub&quot; for example.</p>
<p>However, there is also lower level of strategy that is much more useful/closer to real life.
Some call it tactics or still lump it with strategy.
For example, &quot;we will use this architecture&quot; or &quot;lets invest into to find a better solution for this&quot; or &quot;let&#39;s target this market with this product.&quot;
It is when you know what you can do and how things may turn out and cleverly take
practical steps to reach a more favourable outcome.</p>
<p>For example, something may be ordinarily not possible.
But someone may decide &quot;if we were a little bit clever and did this instead, it could work&quot; and experiment.
And it may lead to a more successful outcome. Or it may not work.
And you may learn that and come one step closer to solving that problem.
The strategist sub-archetype here would correspond to the being clever part.
Rest, I&#39;d put under the visionary archetype.</p>
<h3 id="Visionary-Alchemist"><a href="#Visionary-Alchemist" class="headerlink" title="Visionary / Alchemist"></a>Visionary / Alchemist</h3><p>Someone who imagines possibilities and guides/acts towards bringing them to reality.
I suppose this person is one level above the person who comes up ideas and seeks validation based on it.
They act on turning their ideas into reality.</p>
<p>I suppose you&#39;d put someone like Steve Jobs into this category.
Personally, when I think of a visionary, someone like Einstein or Turing comes to mind.
They did not just come up with ideas.
They went with their ideas. They contributed enough to leave their name in history books.
Probably a high bar to follow for someone from the modern era like Steve Jobs.
I am sure he did he best.</p>
<p>I&#39;d put someone like an entrepreneur in this category.
Maybe someone had a clever business idea.
They went with it. Succeeded or not, they tried to be a leader by trying to make
it happen.</p>
<p>I sometimes put some of my time into a hackathon called random hacks of kindness.
There, individuals called &quot;change makers&quot; pitch ideas for some kind of cause
and usually over a weekend, some hackers get together to build a system or something
that helps further the cause. I&#39;d say those &quot;change makers&quot; are also excellent
examples of this archetypes.</p>
<h4 id="Revolutionary-Crusader"><a href="#Revolutionary-Crusader" class="headerlink" title="Revolutionary / Crusader"></a>Revolutionary / Crusader</h4><p>I see them as a sub-archetype. They are the same as Visionaries.
They differ in that their vision conflicts with status quo / established order.</p>
<h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>There are plenty others. But those I believe are the main ones.
People lead by a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing others,</li>
<li>providing oversight,</li>
<li>contributing time and skills, and</li>
<li>acting on their vision</li>
</ul>
<p>in solving a problem, fulfilling a need or correcting some injustice.</p>

	<div class="article__infos">
		<span class="article__date">2017-12-19</span><br />
		
		
	</div>

	

	
		<p>Both formally and informally, we all have to perform evaluations on a daily basis.
Whether it is doing someone&#39;s performance evaluation at work or
choosing which library to use for a given problem, we can&#39;t escape it.
More often than not, we make errors in this due to the biases and heuristics we have learned to have.
I will try to list some of those here.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t try to list all types of thinking errors.
There was something of a masterlist compiled in a book by
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Thinking-Clearly-Rolf-Dobelli/dp/0062219693" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rolf Dobelli called &quot;The Art Of Thinking Clearly,&quot;</a>.
That book is what bible would read like if it was written today.
If Sun Tzu was from today&#39;s era, he would have had a chapter on it in The Art Of War.
It is a must read for everyone.
It just so happens that I am reading through a HR book and I am
trying to reconcile what I am learning with my past experience by reflecting on it here. So here goes:</p>
<h3 id="Halo-Effect"><a href="#Halo-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Halo Effect"></a>Halo Effect</h3><p>The other day our CEO gave his routine end of year Christmas speech.
He was dressed very informally, grew a bit of a beard, was in a check shirt with some washed up jeans.
Seeing him made a weird thought run through my head:
Why did he dress like a hipster for this particular occasion?</p>
<p>I soon remembered that halo effect was at work.
If it was a different industry, the CEO would have been right to wear an expensive suit.
But, well, I work in the topmost ICT R&amp;D organisation in the country and
almost everyone in the company dresses like that.
Positive things usually aren&#39;t associated with dressing up.
As far as I recall, there was only once when I was asked to dress sharply.
It was during a public marketing event where one of my projects were being presented.
Before that, the only time I dressed up was during my job interview (being ex public service)
and during my first day at work (never again).</p>
<p>Halo effect is our tendency to generalise domain specific
competency across domains.
In above instance, for example, people&#39;s fashion sense
is being seen as an indicator of their competency.
People usually associate a variety of factors to a variety of competencies.
For example, tallness, attractiveness, what kind of car they drive etc.
They do this because they don&#39;t know you and because they are lazy.
So they set their expectation based on things that are easy to derive.</p>
<p>The way to not be influenced by halo effect while giving evaluations is to
establish clear performance evaluation criteria beforehand and sticking to
it. Being conscious of it helps. However, there is still a probability that your
your judgement in those criteria are being swayed.</p>
<h3 id="Horn-Effect"><a href="#Horn-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Horn Effect"></a>Horn Effect</h3><p>Horn effect is the exact opposite of Halo effect where negative attributes
of individuals are taken as an indicator of unrelated competencies negatively.
For example, person X does not like D&amp;D so he must not be a good engineer.
These are just as stupid as Halo Effects.</p>
<p>We are influenced by these biases because these heuristics
usually serve us. For example, food that smell bad are usually rotten
and taste bad. However, we also need to keep in mind that they are just
heuristics. If not, for example, we would never be able to taste great
tasting food like Durian and Papaya if we strictly adhered by those rules.
Once again, being aware of it, being realistic about it and sticking to a
strict set of criteria may help mitigate some of this.</p>
<h3 id="Social-Proof"><a href="#Social-Proof" class="headerlink" title="Social Proof"></a>Social Proof</h3><p>This is another one of those heuristics that serve us. For example,
we typically use libraries and technology that a lot of other people use or say are good.
So we expect it to be good and we are usually satisfied with it either due to the product or the person
either being good or due to self fulfilment prophecy/confirmation bias.
This is why we hire consultants, follow thought leaders and go to conferences etc.
They tell us things that are safe and proven.</p>
<p>I am not saying that we should not do these things.
They provide a lot of value.
I could call someone who did not exploit existing wisdom to maximise his chances
a fool.
What I have problems with is only following established practice and never experimenting.
These will usually serve you well until when you have to step outside your me too box.
For example, when you come up with something exceptional or revolutionary or innovative etc.
These will only slow you down then.</p>
<p>In the tech sector, there are additional things like textbook examples,
accepted practice, &quot;standard practice&quot;, COTS software etc which work
similar to social proof.
For example. when was the last time you built a system that was not
a database backed three layered system?
Sometimes, there are &quot;my way or the high way&quot; people that will penalise
you for what they perceive to be the best solution or, worse, the only way to solve a problem.
It is worse when it is done retrospectively.
&quot;That was a bad decision. Why did you do things this way? It is not standard practice.&quot;
If you have been practising in the industry a while and have ever tried new things,
chances are that you&#39;ve heard phrases similar to this.
Retrospective distortion.
No!
They don&#39;t get to have a say unless they were there originally and spoke for
things to be otherwise.</p>
<p>In machine learning, there is the concept of balancing exploration and exploitation.
I think that is something that should apply universally to professional practice.
When you are giving evaluations, be aware of not dismissing new or different
things and points of view.
When you are in teams with conservative and political people, be a little bit
move a little bit slowly. Be sure to frame things properly and keep them informed etc.</p>
<h3 id="Confirmation-Bias"><a href="#Confirmation-Bias" class="headerlink" title="Confirmation Bias"></a>Confirmation Bias</h3><p>This is one of the worst ones.</p>
<p>Suppose that I referred you to John and said that he is very friendly.
Suppose that in your first interaction with him, he acts in an ambiguous
manner that could be interpreted to be friendly or anything else.
Unless he explicitly expressed hostility, you will most likely
interpret that as a signal to be friendly and it will reinforce
your expectation that he is friendly. What would happen if I
told you instead that he was a little bit crazy.</p>
<p>Few years ago, I came to think that people who write software for the JVM
were not very intelligent. How? I hung out with the wrong thought leaders.
I respected their opinions and they made such opinion known to me.
This is before I learned about confirmation bias and such.
I, of course, have stopped building systems in java and to this date,
I have not met anyone I&#39;d respect to be intelligent who wrote
software for JVM. Except maybe my first mentor. Well, he was also a
polygot like me who programmed in whatever was necessary.
In reality, whether I and them believe if JVM was trash or was the best
platform out there is not of any consequence.
The reason for that is that it is not a rule of nature.
People who think that java is the best thing ever may live their entire
life and satisfy their clients by programming in java.
They are of no consequence to people who think java is absolutely rubbish.
They also can satisfy their clients and live their entire life without
even knowing about the existence of java. There are plenty of other alternatives.
Same thing could be said about 90% of the technologies of today.
Whether you like them or hate them is of no consequence.
But if you are evaluating someone else&#39;s performance
based on your inconsequential beliefs, it stops to be harmless.</p>
<p>More recently, someone told me that functional programming was the
only way to produce correct, robust software.
Academia driven bullshit of course.
Spread by the type of idiots who would have you believe that
the only reason we have wheels is because a scientist wrote a
paper to point out the possibility of wheels.
This person was also a thought leader. Someone I respected.
Unfortunately, this was after I had learned about confirmation bias.
Sure, I have learned a great deal about functional programming since
then including doing formal courses.
I wasn&#39;t gonna dismiss it.
What if it was indeed the promised holy grail?
But I was also humble about it.
I knew that people said similar things about OOP before.
There wasn&#39;t anything particularly difficult about it.
It was just using a different set of concepts than the ones I was used to using.
However, I have not yet stitched over to functional programming as
I have not seen any value or benefit in the change.
There isn&#39;t anything revolutionary in FP that a good static code checker combined
with minimal testing can not overcompensate for.
It is not a particularly interesting programming paradigm either.
So far, staying true to things I value in my professional practice, such as seeing happy clients and users,
has not required it.
I like to think that I am practical.
I would automate away writing code if I could.
So far it is the most boring aspect of my job.
That being said, I&#39;d probably still use a functional programming language if there was a real need for it.
For example, if I was writing code for a pacemaker or sending rockets into space.
The overhead would be more than justified.</p>
<p>Anyways, be careful of the thoughts and opinions you have inside your head.
Especially the ones you feel very strongly about.
See how they influence how you evaluate others.
Also, don&#39;t evaluate people negatively based on how other people might see them.
Of course, bring it to their attention as part of their feedback if you are particularly concerned.</p>
<p>In terms of others being influenced by confirmation bias,
there is not a lot you can do.
Be positive, humble, friendly etc and maybe what goes around will come around.
Even the nicest person in the world will have critiques.</p>
<h3 id="Fundamental-Attribution-Error-And-Similar-To-Me-Errors"><a href="#Fundamental-Attribution-Error-And-Similar-To-Me-Errors" class="headerlink" title="Fundamental Attribution Error And Similar To Me Errors"></a>Fundamental Attribution Error And Similar To Me Errors</h3><p>People have a tendency to explain away other&#39;s behaviour to their attributes
and their own behaviour to environmental factors.
For example, if Mary forgot to write a test case, it is because she lacks attention to detail.
But when I forget to write a test cases, it is always because I was in a rush at the time.</p>
<p>This works in inverse as well.
When we do something successfully, we attribute it to our characteristics.
The project performed beyond expectations because of my slick project management skills.
When the same thing happens for someone else, it is usually due to luck or some other situational circumstances.</p>
<p>This also happens at large scales in groups. E.g. different race,
particular tech stack users, alumni of different universities or
ex colleagues of a particular company etc.
Behaviour of members of other group gets explained away by their attributes
and behaviours of members of our group to circumstances.
This also happens to people and groups you put on pedestals.
If you, for example, think that functional programmers are smarter,
you will experience similar effects.
If you think the opposite, you will also selectively focus on only negative
aspects of that group.</p>
<p>Everyone does it!
It is some kind of a natural defence mechanism.
Unfortunately, it clouds our evaluations, stops our own selves from improving
and stops us from having real relationships with people.
It is something to be very weary of due to another
issue called the recency error. Our brains rarely think comprehensively
about anything. When we evaluate people, we will most likely focus
on one or two events that stood out. These things that stand out are either
very exceptional performance or negative things. Due to the way we process
information, business as usual things usually don&#39;t stand out as much.</p>
<p>So, before highlighting away past events as negative attributes
of other people, consider their circumstances. Chances are that
you could not have done any better in the situation.</p>
<p>And if you want to stand out in your performance reviews,
cause fake panics and take credit for resolving them.
I am kidding. Don&#39;t! That would be unethical.
But keep a list of your accomplishments as well
as you will also forget. Something like a learning log or an
engineers diary can be invaluable during reviews and things.</p>
<p>Another way this goes wrong is when people are put on pedestals.
For example, maybe there is a rock star hire or emerging employee etc.
People build up certain expectations of them.
Things usually work out with help from conformation bias.
However, if they mess up enough or badly, the fall breaks them inside your mind and
all their negative aspects get highlighted.
Another fun effect of putting people on pedestals is
the phenomenon where for one reason or another, you won&#39;t be able to outperform them.
So don&#39;t put people on pedestals.
Everyone are victims of their circumstances or no one is.</p>
<h3 id="Recency-Errors-Primacy-Errors-and-Contrast-Errors"><a href="#Recency-Errors-Primacy-Errors-and-Contrast-Errors" class="headerlink" title="Recency Errors, Primacy Errors and Contrast Errors"></a>Recency Errors, Primacy Errors and Contrast Errors</h3><p>Unless things stand out, evaluations are often done in light
of the most recent set of events and interactions that are fresh in mind.
It is worse when a member or the team or something particularly stands out
during a recent crisis or something.
All the evaluator can think of is that event and that person
and everyone else gets unhelpful mediocre evaluations.</p>
<p>This happens because our brains are incapable of thinking comprehensively
about things. Thinking is a very slow process. It is natural to forget things over time
and you will never remember everything you need to make give good comprehensive evaluations.</p>
<p>What is the cure? If you are in a position where you
know that you will have to give evaluations and feedback,
take notes and use checklists throughout their performance.
If you can&#39;t, you should not giving them evaluations.</p>
<h3 id="Leniency-Errors-Strictness-Error-Error-Of-Central-Tendency"><a href="#Leniency-Errors-Strictness-Error-Error-Of-Central-Tendency" class="headerlink" title="Leniency Errors, Strictness Error, Error Of Central Tendency"></a>Leniency Errors, Strictness Error, Error Of Central Tendency</h3><p>These are errors where the evaluator has tendencies to either positively
or negatively evaluate everyone.
Remember that professor that gave everyone a B-?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#39;ve gone through the entire list.
In my first job, my manager was too lenient.
He was a non-techie manager who only gave positive feedback.
During one of my performance reviews, I demanded a mentor (and got it :D).
I recently had a client who was too strict and gave evaluations mostly in
negatives.
He&#39;d always highlight everything that is wrong with your project.
No word of thanks or compliments when you fixed them.
In a past sprint, when a complement came out of his mouth, the entire team synchronously exclaimed &quot;WHAT DID HE JUST SAY?.&quot;
That was a first!
My last manager had central tendencies and evaluated everyone in the team to be average.
If you screwed up recently, you want to be below average.
Upon reflection, I think he was a bit too conservative.</p>
<p>To avoid this, you need to come up with some kind of strategy.
If you evaluate most people in the negative or average,
there probably something wrong with your personality.
If you evaluate everyone positively all the time,
you are not helping them grow.
So you need to come up with some kind of strategy.
For example, some people scale.</p>
<p>I personally like to follow a barbel strategy.
In terms of giving feedback,
I pick 1-3 things that really stood out about their performance and 1-2 sticking points less than or equal to the number of things that stood out.
Rest is small talk/filler words.
Of course, everyone always does not get to win.
For example, where you have been asked to judge at contests.
You will sometimes have to rank people.
Scoring can work but is time consuming.
I have recently found sorting to be an effective strategy in that where I do pairwise
comparisons based on criteria sections and sort people until I reach an ordering that I think is fair.</p>
<p>Happy evaluatons.</p>
