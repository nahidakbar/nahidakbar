		<p>Both formally and informally, we all have to perform evaluations on a daily basis.
Whether it is doing someone&#39;s performance evaluation at work or
choosing which library to use for a given problem, we can&#39;t escape it.
More often than not, we make errors in this due to the biases and heuristics we have learned to have.
I will try to list some of those here.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t try to list all types of thinking errors.
There was something of a masterlist compiled in a book by
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Thinking-Clearly-Rolf-Dobelli/dp/0062219693" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rolf Dobelli called &quot;The Art Of Thinking Clearly,&quot;</a>.
That book is what bible would read like if it was written today.
If Sun Tzu was from today&#39;s era, he would have had a chapter on it in The Art Of War.
It is a must read for everyone.
It just so happens that I am reading through a HR book and I am
trying to reconcile what I am learning with my past experience by reflecting on it here. So here goes:</p>
<h3 id="Halo-Effect"><a href="#Halo-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Halo Effect"></a>Halo Effect</h3><p>The other day our CEO gave his routine end of year Christmas speech.
He was dressed very informally, grew a bit of a beard, was in a check shirt with some washed up jeans.
Seeing him made a weird thought run through my head:
Why did he dress like a hipster for this particular occasion?</p>
<p>I soon remembered that halo effect was at work.
If it was a different industry, the CEO would have been right to wear an expensive suit.
But, well, I work in the topmost ICT R&amp;D organisation in the country and
almost everyone in the company dresses like that.
Positive things usually aren&#39;t associated with dressing up.
As far as I recall, there was only once when I was asked to dress sharply.
It was during a public marketing event where one of my projects were being presented.
Before that, the only time I dressed up was during my job interview (being ex public service)
and during my first day at work (never again).</p>
<p>Halo effect is our tendency to generalise domain specific
competency across domains.
In above instance, for example, people&#39;s fashion sense
is being seen as an indicator of their competency.
People usually associate a variety of factors to a variety of competencies.
For example, tallness, attractiveness, what kind of car they drive etc.
They do this because they don&#39;t know you and because they are lazy.
So they set their expectation based on things that are easy to derive.</p>
<p>The way to not be influenced by halo effect while giving evaluations is to
establish clear performance evaluation criteria beforehand and sticking to
it. Being conscious of it helps. However, there is still a probability that your
your judgement in those criteria are being swayed.</p>
<h3 id="Horn-Effect"><a href="#Horn-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Horn Effect"></a>Horn Effect</h3><p>Horn effect is the exact opposite of Halo effect where negative attributes
of individuals are taken as an indicator of unrelated competencies negatively.
For example, person X does not like D&amp;D so he must not be a good engineer.
These are just as stupid as Halo Effects.</p>
<p>We are influenced by these biases because these heuristics
usually serve us. For example, food that smell bad are usually rotten
and taste bad. However, we also need to keep in mind that they are just
heuristics. If not, for example, we would never be able to taste great
tasting food like Durian and Papaya if we strictly adhered by those rules.
Once again, being aware of it, being realistic about it and sticking to a
strict set of criteria may help mitigate some of this.</p>
<h3 id="Social-Proof"><a href="#Social-Proof" class="headerlink" title="Social Proof"></a>Social Proof</h3><p>This is another one of those heuristics that serve us. For example,
we typically use libraries and technology that a lot of other people use or say are good.
So we expect it to be good and we are usually satisfied with it either due to the product or the person
either being good or due to self fulfilment prophecy/confirmation bias.
This is why we hire consultants, follow thought leaders and go to conferences etc.
They tell us things that are safe and proven.</p>
<p>I am not saying that we should not do these things.
They provide a lot of value.
I could call someone who did not exploit existing wisdom to maximise his chances
a fool.
What I have problems with is only following established practice and never experimenting.
These will usually serve you well until when you have to step outside your me too box.
For example, when you come up with something exceptional or revolutionary or innovative etc.
These will only slow you down then.</p>
<p>In the tech sector, there are additional things like textbook examples,
accepted practice, &quot;standard practice&quot;, COTS software etc which work
similar to social proof.
For example. when was the last time you built a system that was not
a database backed three layered system?
Sometimes, there are &quot;my way or the high way&quot; people that will penalise
you for what they perceive to be the best solution or, worse, the only way to solve a problem.
It is worse when it is done retrospectively.
&quot;That was a bad decision. Why did you do things this way? It is not standard practice.&quot;
If you have been practising in the industry a while and have ever tried new things,
chances are that you&#39;ve heard phrases similar to this.
Retrospective distortion.
No!
They don&#39;t get to have a say unless they were there originally and spoke for
things to be otherwise.</p>
<p>In machine learning, there is the concept of balancing exploration and exploitation.
I think that is something that should apply universally to professional practice.
When you are giving evaluations, be aware of not dismissing new or different
things and points of view.
When you are in teams with conservative and political people, be a little bit
move a little bit slowly. Be sure to frame things properly and keep them informed etc.</p>
<h3 id="Confirmation-Bias"><a href="#Confirmation-Bias" class="headerlink" title="Confirmation Bias"></a>Confirmation Bias</h3><p>This is one of the worst ones.</p>
<p>Suppose that I referred you to John and said that he is very friendly.
Suppose that in your first interaction with him, he acts in an ambiguous
manner that could be interpreted to be friendly or anything else.
Unless he explicitly expressed hostility, you will most likely
interpret that as a signal to be friendly and it will reinforce
your expectation that he is friendly. What would happen if I
told you instead that he was a little bit crazy.</p>
<p>Few years ago, I came to think that people who write software for the JVM
were not very intelligent. How? I hung out with the wrong thought leaders.
I respected their opinions and they made such opinion known to me.
This is before I learned about confirmation bias and such.
I, of course, have stopped building systems in java and to this date,
I have not met anyone I&#39;d respect to be intelligent who wrote
software for JVM. Except maybe my first mentor. Well, he was also a
polygot like me who programmed in whatever was necessary.
In reality, whether I and them believe if JVM was trash or was the best
platform out there is not of any consequence.
The reason for that is that it is not a rule of nature.
People who think that java is the best thing ever may live their entire
life and satisfy their clients by programming in java.
They are of no consequence to people who think java is absolutely rubbish.
They also can satisfy their clients and live their entire life without
even knowing about the existence of java. There are plenty of other alternatives.
Same thing could be said about 90% of the technologies of today.
Whether you like them or hate them is of no consequence.
But if you are evaluating someone else&#39;s performance
based on your inconsequential beliefs, it stops to be harmless.</p>
<p>More recently, someone told me that functional programming was the
only way to produce correct, robust software.
Academia driven bullshit of course.
Spread by the type of idiots who would have you believe that
the only reason we have wheels is because a scientist wrote a
paper to point out the possibility of wheels.
This person was also a thought leader. Someone I respected.
Unfortunately, this was after I had learned about confirmation bias.
Sure, I have learned a great deal about functional programming since
then including doing formal courses.
I wasn&#39;t gonna dismiss it.
What if it was indeed the promised holy grail?
But I was also humble about it.
I knew that people said similar things about OOP before.
There wasn&#39;t anything particularly difficult about it.
It was just using a different set of concepts than the ones I was used to using.
However, I have not yet stitched over to functional programming as
I have not seen any value or benefit in the change.
There isn&#39;t anything revolutionary in FP that a good static code checker combined
with minimal testing can not overcompensate for.
It is not a particularly interesting programming paradigm either.
So far, staying true to things I value in my professional practice, such as seeing happy clients and users,
has not required it.
I like to think that I am practical.
I would automate away writing code if I could.
So far it is the most boring aspect of my job.
That being said, I&#39;d probably still use a functional programming language if there was a real need for it.
For example, if I was writing code for a pacemaker or sending rockets into space.
The overhead would be more than justified.</p>
<p>Anyways, be careful of the thoughts and opinions you have inside your head.
Especially the ones you feel very strongly about.
See how they influence how you evaluate others.
Also, don&#39;t evaluate people negatively based on how other people might see them.
Of course, bring it to their attention as part of their feedback if you are particularly concerned.</p>
<p>In terms of others being influenced by confirmation bias,
there is not a lot you can do.
Be positive, humble, friendly etc and maybe what goes around will come around.
Even the nicest person in the world will have critiques.</p>
<h3 id="Fundamental-Attribution-Error-And-Similar-To-Me-Errors"><a href="#Fundamental-Attribution-Error-And-Similar-To-Me-Errors" class="headerlink" title="Fundamental Attribution Error And Similar To Me Errors"></a>Fundamental Attribution Error And Similar To Me Errors</h3><p>People have a tendency to explain away other&#39;s behaviour to their attributes
and their own behaviour to environmental factors.
For example, if Mary forgot to write a test case, it is because she lacks attention to detail.
But when I forget to write a test cases, it is always because I was in a rush at the time.</p>
<p>This works in inverse as well.
When we do something successfully, we attribute it to our characteristics.
The project performed beyond expectations because of my slick project management skills.
When the same thing happens for someone else, it is usually due to luck or some other situational circumstances.</p>
<p>This also happens at large scales in groups. E.g. different race,
particular tech stack users, alumni of different universities or
ex colleagues of a particular company etc.
Behaviour of members of other group gets explained away by their attributes
and behaviours of members of our group to circumstances.
This also happens to people and groups you put on pedestals.
If you, for example, think that functional programmers are smarter,
you will experience similar effects.
If you think the opposite, you will also selectively focus on only negative
aspects of that group.</p>
<p>Everyone does it!
It is some kind of a natural defence mechanism.
Unfortunately, it clouds our evaluations, stops our own selves from improving
and stops us from having real relationships with people.
It is something to be very weary of due to another
issue called the recency error. Our brains rarely think comprehensively
about anything. When we evaluate people, we will most likely focus
on one or two events that stood out. These things that stand out are either
very exceptional performance or negative things. Due to the way we process
information, business as usual things usually don&#39;t stand out as much.</p>
<p>So, before highlighting away past events as negative attributes
of other people, consider their circumstances. Chances are that
you could not have done any better in the situation.</p>
<p>And if you want to stand out in your performance reviews,
cause fake panics and take credit for resolving them.
I am kidding. Don&#39;t! That would be unethical.
But keep a list of your accomplishments as well
as you will also forget. Something like a learning log or an
engineers diary can be invaluable during reviews and things.</p>
<p>Another way this goes wrong is when people are put on pedestals.
For example, maybe there is a rock star hire or emerging employee etc.
People build up certain expectations of them.
Things usually work out with help from conformation bias.
However, if they mess up enough or badly, the fall breaks them inside your mind and
all their negative aspects get highlighted.
Another fun effect of putting people on pedestals is
the phenomenon where for one reason or another, you won&#39;t be able to outperform them.
So don&#39;t put people on pedestals.
Everyone are victims of their circumstances or no one is.</p>
<h3 id="Recency-Errors-Primacy-Errors-and-Contrast-Errors"><a href="#Recency-Errors-Primacy-Errors-and-Contrast-Errors" class="headerlink" title="Recency Errors, Primacy Errors and Contrast Errors"></a>Recency Errors, Primacy Errors and Contrast Errors</h3><p>Unless things stand out, evaluations are often done in light
of the most recent set of events and interactions that are fresh in mind.
It is worse when a member or the team or something particularly stands out
during a recent crisis or something.
All the evaluator can think of is that event and that person
and everyone else gets unhelpful mediocre evaluations.</p>
<p>This happens because our brains are incapable of thinking comprehensively
about things. Thinking is a very slow process. It is natural to forget things over time
and you will never remember everything you need to make give good comprehensive evaluations.</p>
<p>What is the cure? If you are in a position where you
know that you will have to give evaluations and feedback,
take notes and use checklists throughout their performance.
If you can&#39;t, you should not giving them evaluations.</p>
<h3 id="Leniency-Errors-Strictness-Error-Error-Of-Central-Tendency"><a href="#Leniency-Errors-Strictness-Error-Error-Of-Central-Tendency" class="headerlink" title="Leniency Errors, Strictness Error, Error Of Central Tendency"></a>Leniency Errors, Strictness Error, Error Of Central Tendency</h3><p>These are errors where the evaluator has tendencies to either positively
or negatively evaluate everyone.
Remember that professor that gave everyone a B-?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#39;ve gone through the entire list.
In my first job, my manager was too lenient.
He was a non-techie manager who only gave positive feedback.
During one of my performance reviews, I demanded a mentor (and got it :D).
I recently had a client who was too strict and gave evaluations mostly in
negatives.
He&#39;d always highlight everything that is wrong with your project.
No word of thanks or compliments when you fixed them.
In a past sprint, when a complement came out of his mouth, the entire team synchronously exclaimed &quot;WHAT DID HE JUST SAY?.&quot;
That was a first!
My last manager had central tendencies and evaluated everyone in the team to be average.
If you screwed up recently, you want to be below average.
Upon reflection, I think he was a bit too conservative.</p>
<p>To avoid this, you need to come up with some kind of strategy.
If you evaluate most people in the negative or average,
there probably something wrong with your personality.
If you evaluate everyone positively all the time,
you are not helping them grow.
So you need to come up with some kind of strategy.
For example, some people scale.</p>
<p>I personally like to follow a barbel strategy.
In terms of giving feedback,
I pick 1-3 things that really stood out about their performance and 1-2 sticking points less than or equal to the number of things that stood out.
Rest is small talk/filler words.
Of course, everyone always does not get to win.
For example, where you have been asked to judge at contests.
You will sometimes have to rank people.
Scoring can work but is time consuming.
I have recently found sorting to be an effective strategy in that where I do pairwise
comparisons based on criteria sections and sort people until I reach an ordering that I think is fair.</p>
<p>Happy evaluatons.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2017/12/17/2017-12-17/">What Is Leadership?</a></h1>
	
	<div class="article__infos">
		<span class="article__date">2017-12-17</span><br />
		
		
	</div>

	

	
		<p>Saw this meme the other day:</p>
<p><figure class="figure"><img src="/contents/2017-12-17/boss-leader-engineer.png" alt=""></figure></p>
<p>Reminded me of some past episodes and made me chuckle.</p>
<p><s>Leadership has been a subject of interest from the earliest days of human society.</s></p>
<p>That is wrong!
In my mind, leadership something more natural and intrinsic to life.
I quite dislike the notion where humans are viewed to be somehow external to or above nature.
Sure we don&#39;t live naked in caves and trees any more and we have people in space.
However, to get you down from your rocket ship, consider the following: if another big meteor fell on earth tomorrow, most humans will die along with other species in nature we claim superiority over.
In addition, regardless of however you define leadership, you will no doubt find examples in non-human species.
That is - it is not something unique to or invented by humans.
I don&#39;t, however, expect this reflection to be relevant to baboons and naked mole rats.
So I also want to keep things practical by not straying too far from my own species
and my own practice.</p>
<p>So what is leadership? Let&#39;s check out <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/leadership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dictionary.com</a>.
It defines leadership as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>noun</p>
<ol>
<li>the position or function of a leader, a person who guides or directs a group:<blockquote>
<p>He managed to maintain his leadership of the party despite heavy opposition.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>ability to lead:<blockquote>
<p>As early as sixth grade she displayed remarkable leadership potential.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>an act or instance of leading; guidance; direction:<blockquote>
<p>They prospered under his strong leadership.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>the leaders of a group:<blockquote>
<p>The union leadership agreed to arbitrate.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading that, you have probably agreed to one or more of the definitions and gave them a mental tick of approval.
Time to clue you in on something.
At least from my perspective, these definitions are all missing a lot of crucial things.
That is: why? to what end?
I&#39;ve checked at least two other dictionaries and they don&#39;t fare much better.
It does not make it better when you define leadership as a process or science or art or rational or irrational.
It might have been something so obvious so they decided to not put it in.
However, it is the most important thing to me for the following reasons:</p>
<p>First, it simplifies the problem of leadership. Say there is certain issue,
problem X, that needs to be resolved. Which of the following is a better
way of framing this problem? 1) problem is to resolve x through leading
a team of followers or 2) problem is to resolve x. I would take 2 over 1
any day of the week. Why? Because - problem solving 101 - it opens up options.
With 2, the problem can be solved any way possible. For example, hiring
and expert to do the work or, my favourite, going to the root cause of problem X
and eliminating it so that X ceases to be problem.
However, with 1, it assumed that a very fixed, potentially ineffective, inefficient or risky method
of accomplishing potentially less than an ideal solution for problem X.</p>
<p>Second, here are some trick questions for thought: Would a person be less of a leader if he/she:</p>
<ul>
<li>resolved the problem without a team following them; or</li>
<li>lead a large team as opposed to small one; or</li>
<li>was old or young; or</li>
<li>was tall or short; or</li>
<li>was male or female or some other gender; or</li>
<li>was of white skin colour or black or yellow or...; or</li>
<li>was superstitious or not; or</li>
<li>was experienced vs inexperienced; or</li>
<li>spoke perfect English or not; or</li>
<li>knew how to spell or not; or</li>
<li>was good at public speaking or not; or</li>
<li>lead a diverse team or not; or</li>
<li>lead a multidisciplinary team or not; or</li>
<li>was technically literate or not; or</li>
<li>was a rock star or a peon; or</li>
<li>followed some mythology or not; or</li>
<li>consulted a consultant or not; or</li>
<li>was a subject matter expert or not; or</li>
<li>owned many slaves or didn&#39;t; or</li>
<li>was introverted or extroverted; or</li>
<li>was a born leader or not; or</li>
<li>was from the royal family or not; or</li>
<li>insert your stupid leadership criteria here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on how biased you are, and trust me everyone is biased in some ways, you may have not liked how some of these sentences were worded.
Even I didn&#39;t like listing all these.
However, if you change the definition of leadership from things like &quot;influencing/emotional manipulation&quot; and &quot;standing above others&quot; to
&quot;bringing positive change&quot; or something more practical, these things stop to matter.</p>
<p>Third, you get problems when you don&#39;t ask this question.
Say the mad king from game of thrones asks his solders to burn everyone in city with wildfire.
Should this order be followed? When you ask this question - king is a leader who people pay tax to and follow to keep them safe etc and make country
more prosperous etc.
When they stop doing that, they cease to be their leader.
So the mad king gets burned instead.
Why am I giving example from a fictional story? I obviously don&#39;t want to piss off real examples.
However, these examples are not absent even in developed/lower power distance cultures.
For example, you have people in positions of authority sexually abusing people under them.
Once again, I am not going to piss of real examples.
This also happen in nature.
For example, in most tournament species in nature, there are leaders called &quot;alphas&quot; who do whatever they want
in their group.
Humans, of-course, are not tournament species and modern human societal values do not condone these forms of power abuse.</p>
<p>At last, due to these reasons, it is wrong to define leadership something along the lines of standing above others.
The best definition of leadership I&#39;ve found so far is in the High Performance Leadership manual from
Toastmasters. It goes something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>someone assumes a leadership role when someone decides there is a problem, a need or an injustice and takes action to solve the problem, fulfil the need or correct the injustice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These types of definitions are not probably attractive to most people.
It does not sound as impressive as &quot;being the chosen one&quot; or
&quot;the leader of men&quot; or what not and
does not bring assciated social validation or financial benefits.
Those are typical reasons why most people pursue leadership
and why it has probably become a hundreds of billion dollar industry
worldwide.
However, I am more attracted to the above definition.
I am probably a bit selfishly motvivated in my belief as it does
not require having a crowd following you to be a leader.
Yes, I am no celebrety or thought leader and
the tought creeps me out a little bit.</p>
<p>At the same time, this kind of drive feels much more authentic to me than
the trashy literature that gets sold as authentic leadership.
It suggests to me that to become a great leader, instead of trying to be a
great leader, you should focus on the problem you are trying to solve,
the need you are trying and the injustice you are trying to correct.
That is - great leaders aren&#39;t obsessed on being great leaders.
They are focused on their objectives, missions, values etc.
Only in that context, I can see being able to rally others&#39; support
to be an asset. It should not be an honour or a priviledge.
Instead, the leader should be thankful in whatever followership support
they get for their problem, need or cause.</p>
<p>Followership, in this context, is also a form of leadership.
That is - if you decided that the particular cause is worth your time
and decide that you can provide some value.
Leaders, then, should be aknowledged based on the value they personally bring.
It takes great wishdom and leadership to sometimes go
with the flow in trying something new contrary to personal experience
when someone else is taking the lead and learn from that experiment.
Ofcourse, if there is some reason why you think the path you are on
will not work, it is part of leadership let that be known.
Malicious compliance is unethical.
However, in my book, the only people who are not leaders are people blindly
following orders and processes.
People not in control over their own actions.
People who don&#39;t ask the question &quot;why?&quot; and &quot;to what end?&quot; .
They are just exchanging their followership for salary.
Asking &quot;why?&quot; and &quot;to what end?&quot; also leads to asking &quot;how to better?&quot;</p>

		<p>It turned out I was only allowed to do a case study using publicly available
secondary data.
I may have also dodged a bullet there.
While reviewing literature, I&#39;ve come across a few too many primary data
business research papers which were a bit too half-assed.
They usually come up with a hypothesis, call up dozen or so people with loaded
interview questions and come up with conclusions based on those answers.
While, this is probably sufficient in the realm of social sciences,
seems somewhat inadequate in my mind.
These would never qualify to be published in computer science journals I usually
find myself reading.
Also, I find myself arguing with superstitious nutbags about science simply
representing the best of human knowledge and reasoning from time to time.
I expect a greater level of effort to be put into research than a dozen phone
calls.
10000 is a much better number!</p>
<p>I finally decided to go with something along the lines of &quot;application of 
financial forecasting for entrepreneurial opportunity recognition&quot; for my
research topic.
It wasn&#39;t easy to come up with a topic.
I think I&#39;ve read a few too many Nassim Talib books.
That guy hates forecasting with his entire being and I tend to agree with a
lot of his ideas.
From how the preliminary data analysis is looking, I&#39;d say that my study
will produce very similar conclusions.</p>
<p>I am happy with the topic.
Judging by my colleagues&#39; stated background and their comments, mine is probably
one of the broadest topics in my group.
Although, I initially proposed something much broader.
I wanted to do some impact analysis on the side.
Feedback, that came two weeks too late, stated that I should shorten it.
Pivoted to my current topic which is half of what I originally proposed.
Took two weeks off from work to focus exclusively on it.
I am now back on track.
Just gotta finish data analysis and complete my report write-up.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve fallen back to python for this research project.
This makes modelling so much easier.
I usually just use JavaScript or Golang these days at work.
I had completely forgotten how much more productive python was.
If I want to do something crazy like model some time series data with the
logistic map, and use that to produce forecasts, it&#39;s only a dozen or so lines
of scipy code.</p>
<p>Back to work tomorrow.
Went through my email today and it looks like I&#39;ll have to hit the ground
running.

Only two and half weeks left to finalise my work and submit report.</p>
