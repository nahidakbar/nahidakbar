		<p>I&#39;ve been having a bit of hard time on deciding on a research topic to finish
off my masters project.
Doing something with secondary data seems like it will be perfect for saving
time and would play to my strengths.
At the same time, I feel as through I should push myself a bit out of my
comfort zone and try something a bit more full on.
I&#39;ll have to make a decision in the next week or so.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started going through the textbook (Saunders et al on research methods).
Have only gone through the first chapter and seems to be a good read so far.
Few things stood out for me:</p>
<p>Firstly, it differentiates <strong>methods</strong> and <strong>methodology</strong>.
Methods, it argues, are simply techniques and procedures.
Methodology, in contrast, relate to the theory of how it should be conducted.
For example, a survey would be a method.
In contrast, the rationale behind if a survey would be an appropriate method
for a research problem would be methodology.</p>
<p>Secondly, it defined important characteristics of research.
Research, it argued, is not simply information collection and reportinng on
these.
For example, if you interviewed a bunch of people and released a report of your
opinions on what the data you collected means, you can&#39;t call it research.
Even through, the activities are the same, for something to be research, it
needs to fulfil the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>There must be a clear purpose</li>
<li>Data must be collected systematically</li>
<li>Data must be interpreted systematically</li>
</ul>
<p>Systematically implies basis on logical relationships, not on beliefs and
opinions.
In the above case, for example, it would be valid research if the interview
was an appropriate method to logically infer the research of results.</p>
<p>For example, a research problem might be to deduce if all managers are lazy.
If someone interviewed a 10000 managers and determined each one of them to
be lazy, and reported on this result, it will not be enough to show that
all managers are lazy.
It can only logically prove that some managers are lazy.
All managers could only be lazy if it can be proved that those 10000 managers
interviewed represent all possible types of managers, such as, hard working
managers, fat managers, tall managers, unicycle riding managers etc.</p>
<p>You&#39;d also need to be very clear about what you mean by lazy.
For example, my parents think I am lazy as I &quot;play on my computer all day.&quot;
When they think &quot;hard working,&quot; perhaps an image similar to farmers digging
holes in barren land come to their mind.
My employers, on the other hand, is somewhat grateful that I spend on day in
front of a computer and would interpret it differently.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it provided a framework for considering relevance gap.
It organised research across two dimensions:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Low Theoretical Rigour</th>
<th>High Theoretical Rigour</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>High Practical Relevance</strong></td>
<td>Popularist Science</td>
<td>Pragmatic Science</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Low Practical Relevance</strong></td>
<td>Puerile Science</td>
<td>Pedantic Science</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In this view, relevance gap exist between the top and bottom rows.
I liked how it used the word &quot;puerile&quot; to describe science that has little
practical relevance and is not rigorous.</p>
<p>Fourthly, it presented four modes of knowledge creation where research
objectives are determined by:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Mode</th>
<th>Objectives determined by</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Mode 1</td>
<td>academic interests</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mode 2</td>
<td>practical needs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mode 0</td>
<td>sponsor&#39;s interests</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mode 3</td>
<td>survival and common good</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There was more info on maintaining reflexive diaries etc.</p>
<p>Hoping to cover more ground on the book before settling on a topic and further
planning.</p>

	</div>

	

	
		<p>I&#39;ve been putting some of my free time into a new open source project called Janus. It is meant to be a diagramming tool for various activities around software projects. Frankly, I am just writing this tool for myself.</p>
<p>Imagine the following very common scenario. You go into a meeting with some new clients. Things run very smoothly. They are excited about getting their product from you. You are excited about building their product for them. You decide that you are going to start working on this as soon as the paperwork is done. And after doing some basic requirements analysis at the start, you discover that you didn&#39;t even ask that very basic question that you need to start.</p>
<p>Well, it is not really your fault. Normal human brain does not work in detailed lists. The problem is more the fact that the you did not do your analysis early enough.</p>
<p>Here is a tool for doing so! I am hoping to turn it into something that can greatly assist engineers in real time in generating questions and doing basic analysis to make these sessions more effective.</p>
<p>It still has a <a href="http://janus.nahidakbar.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long way to go</a>.</p>
