		<p>This educational is from toastmasters
leadership excellence series.
Purpose of this series is for all of us to become
better at leadership.</p>
<p>I have not picked this topic because
I think I know the most about this topic.
I have picked it because
I have more horror stories to share
where I&#39;ve seen examples of this being
done poorly and I have recognised
that I myself have a lot to learn
in this area.</p>
<h3 id="Why-delegate"><a href="#Why-delegate" class="headerlink" title="Why delegate?"></a>Why delegate?</h3><p>We delegate for three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To free our own time. We may not have the time or may want to spend time selectively on areas and projects we went to develop of.</li>
<li>To get things done faster. There may be cases where delegation is not feasible.
For example, when you have a very complex ad-hoc process, delegation may slow things down instead.
However, where it is feasible, doing things in a team may help get things done faster.</li>
<li>To other give people development opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-is-delegation"><a href="#What-is-delegation" class="headerlink" title="What is delegation?"></a>What is delegation?</h3><p>Definitions of delegation must have two aspects:</p>
<p>First is the transfer of responsibility.
Delegation here is distinguished from training or supervision.
While those activities and ideas have value, delegation is distinctly
different in that the responsibility for the outcome
is transferred to the person delegated.
We might be training or supervising someone closely
where they perform tasks according to our instruction
to learn something.
However, in these cases, should the endeavour fail, the responsibility
for failure should go to the trainer or the supervisor.</p>
<p>This leads nicely to the second aspect - empowerment to accomplish
goals.
This is where delegation is distinguished from things like
micromanagement.
When we are closely supervising someone
and they have done exactly as we have told them to the best of their ability,
they can not blamed when the endeavour fails.
When we delegate something to someone,
it implies that they have them all the decision making
authority over everything that needs to be influenced
to accomplish the set task.
This is the aspect of empowerment.</p>
<p>An example of this where these aspects
are absent might be that micromanager
who after making you responsible for
a project tries to influence every
small detail of the project.
Another example might be
an organisation where you
might be responsible for a project
but getting your tasks done requires
approvals from a manager higher in the chain.</p>
<p>There are times where this might be necessary.
I had a year 10 work experience student couple of years ago.
I tried to be a good manager and not a micromanager.
At least initially, and delegated them some tasks.
I left him alone for an entire day.
I was a little bit impressed by his resume and what he said.
He had published an app in the appstore.
I have yet to publish an app in the appstore. Never had a work or hobby project that involved doing that.
But of course, as I had learned, a year 10 student is not half as good as they think they are.
I discovered on day two that not only did he not accomplish
anything, he was making some really stupid mistakes in the
little progress he had made.
So there are times where you may need to
micromanage things a little.</p>
<p>However, I would also argue that there are better ways of doing it.
My current manager does it really well.
It might be partially because he does not have a lot of time for me.
If he received any signals where he thinks I might be going
off track on a project,
he suggests that I hold a project review
or informally talk with another colleague on a different team.
You can encourage them to seek feedback.
For example, I have asked my mentor to be brutal if she sees anything wrong with
what I do.
I was going to ask her to do it but the way the conversation flowed at the time,
it was almost as if she put the words in
my mouth.
These work a lot better the the manager barging in and start micromanaging
whatever respect you might have for your manage out of your system.</p>
<h3 id="When-to-delegate"><a href="#When-to-delegate" class="headerlink" title="When to delegate?"></a>When to delegate?</h3><p>There is a section in the educational material on barriers to delegation.
And this section corresponds to that.
But instead of going through the points, I want to give you a framework
for thinking about it. It is called the situational leadership model which
looks something like this:</p>
<p><figure class="figure"><img src="/contents/2018-01-30/situational.png" alt="From https://www.kenblanchard.com"><figcaption class="figure__caption">From https://www.kenblanchard.com</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>This model splits people in terms of two variables. First is the level of commitment
where people are put into two categories - highly committed (bottom half) and
not so committed (top half). Second variable is their level of competence
where people are also put into two categories - highly capable (left half)
and the highly incapable (right half). This model suggests
that people usually vary across the spectrum in terms of these two
variables and different strategies work for different people.</p>
<p>Delegation here only works for people who are highly committed
and are highly capable (the bottom left quadrant).
If they are highly capable but is not committed, you have to get their
motivation level up by supportive/participate behaviour (top left quadrant).
If they are highly committed but they are not as competent,
you can exhibit telling/directing behaviour (bottom right).
This is where micromanagement shines.
If they are neither committed nor capable, you have to either
coach them or sell things to them.</p>
<p>The handout gives some other points which you can put into
this framework and talks about some more like insecurity and selfishness
on behalf of the leader. But I want to talk about another point
that is not in the handout. That is, you can sometimes destroy a good team
by delegating poorly.
I will give two examples. One somewhat artificial and
another from my current team.</p>
<p>First example is from a game I play called left for dead 2.
Don&#39;t shut your brain off. This example has nothing to do with computer gaming.
It is a computer game that is designed in a way where you
have to work in a team of 4 to survive a zombie apocalyptic scenario.
If you don&#39;t have a good team like an incompetent team or dysfunctional team,
you quickly die.
Depending on the chinning, sometimes you can make do if you have one or two members who are highly
competent.
So one night I was playing in a game in a team of three.
We were all highly competent.
In fact, we were competing within the team to see who can get the highest score.
In term literature, you could say that this was an example of a highly performing
self organising team.
Then this guy comes along to join us as the fourth member.
And he suddenly starts using mic.
He starts telling everyone what we should do moments after we decide in our head
that we are going to do.
We has trying to play &quot;Mr. Leader&quot; as he saw his role was and
other team members were extremely annoyed by that.
I knew this was the case when he got into trouble and
no one decided to come to his aid until it has too late.
At this point, he abruptly rage quit. He left the team.</p>
<p>The second example would be something like my current work example.
We have a team what you could also say is a highly performing self organising team.
The team consists of three specialists, I being one of them, and a project manager.
It is not a team where the leader is playing &quot;Mr leader&quot; and getting things
done through delegation or micromanagement.
We don&#39;t need that.
In fact, in 99% of the time, out project managers will simply go
what is going on with you and is there anything I can help with.
We are all proactive and self managing and we delegate things to
her and we delegate things to each other.
We talk to each other and get things done.
Everyone in the team performs a leadership role.</p>
<p>If you are ever in an environment like that, don&#39;t try and ruin it by
unnecessarily trying to delegate things or playing the micromanager.
So it is important to think about when not to delegate things
as leader as much as when to delegate things.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-effectively"><a href="#How-to-effectively" class="headerlink" title="How to effectively?"></a>How to effectively?</h3><p>First step in effective delegation is prioritisation.
Simply decide what needs to be delegated.
As we have been discussing, not all work can be delegated.
You may not have the right team members and you may not have the right tasks.
Identify the ones that can be delegated.</p>
<p>Second step is matching availability to capability.
Decide whom to delegate to.
We have talked about the situational leadership model.
These can help inform what strategy to pursue in getting
tasks done. You may choose to decide that
something is not best delegated. Maybe you instead decide
to coach a motivated team member instead through the process
instead. Some people also suggest do it yourself first
so you can describe the objectives clearly.</p>
<p>Third step is assigning responsibility.
It is important to make the assignment clear and specific.
If you read the educational material, it will
ask you fully describe the task and process
and identify training needs and resources
and everything.
I personally don&#39;t like this style of task allocation.
This stems from a style of thinking originated
in the 1900s in America where the managers had to
get a workforce of largely uneducated workforce
to do tasks and not reduce quality of products.
If you allocate tasks this way, you team will be
unhappy and unsatisfied with their job etc.
I think it works better if you clearly specify
the objectives that needs to accomplished.
So they are free to reach the objective
however they want to.</p>
<p>Fourth step is measuring performance.
Autonomy, as we&#39;ve discussed is very important.
They need to be able to solve problems by
themselves and be creative and all that.
However, being completely indifferent to progress
towards objectives is also an anti-pattern.
You need to make sure that progress is being made.
As my first mentor taught me many years ago:
You need to always ask the question: is this
taking me where I want to go?
Is there a better way?</p>
<p>Final step is giving credit and not blaming them so much
should the endeavour fail.
Feedback giving is not a foreign concept to us toastmasters.
We know about the sandwich technique.
It is important to cultivate a culture of feedback giving
in your team.
Not just once a year during performance reviews and what not.
And I think it starts by you asking your team:
how can i do this better?
When things go well, you need to give credit to your team
members publicly.
This will encourage them to be more proactive.
And when things don&#39;t go well, you need to not public blame them.
Give feedback in private.</p>
